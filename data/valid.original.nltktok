 It is the fashion , growled the man . I meet no dinner anywhere . 
 He took out a blackened pipe , filled it , lighted it with flint and steel , pulled at it until it was in a bright glow : then , suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb , that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke . 
 Touch then . It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations . They again joined hands . 
 To-night ? said the mender of roads . 
 To-night , said the man , putting the pipe in his mouth . 
 Where ? 
 Here . 
 He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another , with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets , until the sky began to clear over the village . 
 Show me ! said the traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill . 
 See ! returned the mender of roads , with extended finger . You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the fountain
 To the Devil with all that ! interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape . I go through no streets and past no fountains . Well ? 
 Well ! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village . 
 Good . When do you cease to work ? 
 At sunset . 
 Will you wake me , before departing ? I have walked two nights without resting . Let me finish my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child . Will you wake me ? 
 Surely . 
 The wayfarer smoked his pipe out , put it in his breast , slipped off his great wooden shoes , and lay down on his back on the heap of stones . He was fast asleep directly . 
 As the road-mender plied his dusty labour , and the hail-clouds , rolling away , revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape , the little man (who wore a red cap now , in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones . His eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account . The bronze face , the shaggy black hair and beard , the coarse woollen red cap , the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts , the powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep , inspired the mender of roads with awe . The traveller had travelled far , and his feet were footsore , and his ankles chafed and bleeding ; his great shoes , stuffed with leaves and grass , had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues , and his clothes were chafed into holes , as he himself was into sores . Stooping down beside him , the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not ; but , in vain , for he slept with his arms crossed upon him , and set as resolutely as his lips . Fortified towns with their stockades , guard-houses , gates , trenches , and drawbridges , seemed to the mender of roads , to be so much air as against this figure . And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around , he saw in his small fancy similar figures , stopped by no obstacle , tending to centres all over France . 
 The man slept on , indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness , to sunshine on his face and shadow , to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them , until the sun was low in the west , and the sky was glowing . Then , the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him . 
 Good ! said the sleeper , rising on his elbow . Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill ? 
 About . 
 About . Good ! 
 The mender of roads went home , with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind , and was soon at the fountain , squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink , and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village . When the village had taken its poor supper , it did not creep to bed , as it usually did , but came out of doors again , and remained there . A curious contagion of whispering was upon it , and also , when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark , another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only . Monsieur Gabelle , chief functionary of the place , became uneasy ; went out on his house-top alone , and looked in that direction too ; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below , and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church , that there might be need to ring the tocsin by-and-bye . 
 The night deepened . The trees environing the old chateau , keeping its solitary state apart , moved in a rising wind , as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom . Up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly , and beat at the great door , like a swift messenger rousing those within ; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall , among the old spears and knives , and passed lamenting up the stairs , and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept . East , West , North , and South , through the woods , four heavy-treading , unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches , striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard . Four lights broke out there , and moved away in different directions , and all was black again . 
 But , not for long . Presently , the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own , as though it were growing luminous . Then , a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front , picking out transparent places , and showing where balustrades , arches , and windows were . Then it soared higher , and grew broader and brighter . Soon , from a score of the great windows , flames burst forth , and the stone faces awakened , stared out of fire . 
 A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there , and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away . There was spurring and splashing through the darkness , and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain , and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door . Help , Gabelle ! Help , every one ! The tocsin rang impatiently , but other help (if that were any) there was none . The mender of roads , and two hundred and fifty particular friends , stood with folded arms at the fountain , looking at the pillar of fire in the sky . It must be forty feet high , said they , grimly ; and never moved . 
 The rider from the chateau , and the horse in a foam , clattered away through the village , and galloped up the stony steep , to the prison on the crag . At the gate , a group of officers were looking at the fire ; removed from them , a group of soldiers . Help , gentlemenofficers ! The chateau is on fire ; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid ! Help , help ! The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire ; gave no orders ; and answered , with shrugs and biting of lips , It must burn . 
 As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street , the village was illuminating . The mender of roads , and the two hundred and fifty particular friends , inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up , had darted into their houses , and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass . The general scarcity of everything , occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle ; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part , the mender of roads , once so submissive to authority , had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with , and that post-horses would roast . 
 The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn . In the roaring and raging of the conflagration , a red-hot wind , driving straight from the infernal regions , seemed to be blowing the edifice away . With the rising and falling of the blaze , the stone faces showed as if they were in torment . When great masses of stone and timber fell , the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured : anon struggled out of the smoke again , as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis , burning at the stake and contending with the fire . 
 The chateau burned ; the nearest trees , laid hold of by the fire , scorched and shrivelled ; trees at a distance , fired by the four fierce figures , begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke . Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain ; the water ran dry ; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat , and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame . Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls , like crystallisation ; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace ; four fierce figures trudged away , East , West , North , and South , along the night-enshrouded roads , guided by the beacon they had lighted , towards their next destination . The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin , and , abolishing the lawful ringer , rang for joy . 
 Not only that ; but the village , light-headed with famine , fire , and bell-ringing , and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxesthough it was but a small instalment of taxes , and no rent at all , that Gabelle had got in those latter daysbecame impatient for an interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forth for personal conference . Whereupon , Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door , and retire to hold counsel with himself . The result of that conference was , that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament) , to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet , and crush a man or two below . 
 Probably , Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there , with the distant chateau for fire and candle , and the beating at his door , combined with the joy-ringing , for music ; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate , which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour . A trying suspense , to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean , ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved ! But , the friendly dawn appearing at last , and the rush-candles of the village guttering out , the people happily dispersed , and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while . 
 Within a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets , where they had been born and bred ; also , there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows , upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn . But , the fierce figures were steadily wending East , West , North , and South , be that as it would ; and whosoever hung , fire burned . The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it , no functionary , by any stretch of mathematics , was able to calculate successfully . 
 In such risings of fire and risings of seathe firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shorethree years of tempest were consumed . Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home . 
 Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet . For , the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people , tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger , changed into wild beasts , by terrible enchantment long persisted in . 
 Monseigneur , as a class , had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated : of his being so little wanted in France , as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it , and this life together . Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains , and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the Enemy no question , but immediately fled ; so , Monseigneur , after boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years , and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One , no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels . 
 The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone , or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets . It had never been a good eye to see withhad long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride , Sardanapalus's luxury , and a mole's blindnessbut it had dropped out and was gone . The Court , from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue , corruption , and dissimulation , was all gone together . Royalty was gone ; had been besieged in its Palace and suspended , when the last tidings came over . 
 The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come , and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide . 
 As was natural , the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur , in London , was Tellson's Bank . Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted , and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be . Moreover , it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon , came quickest . Again : Tellson's was a munificent house , and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate . Again : those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time , and anticipating plunder or confiscation , had made provident remittances to Tellson's , were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren . To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's , almost as a matter of course . For such variety of reasons , Tellson's was at that time , as to French intelligence , a kind of High Exchange ; and this was so well known to the public , and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows , for all who ran through Temple Bar to read . 
 On a steaming , misty afternoon , Mr . Lorry sat at his desk , and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it , talking with him in a low voice . The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House , was now the news-Exchange , and was filled to overflowing . It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing . 
 But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , said Charles Darnay , rather hesitating , I must still suggest to you
 I understand . That I am too old ? said Mr . Lorry . 
 Unsettled weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , a disorganised country , a city that may not be even safe for you . 
 My dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , with cheerful confidence , you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my staying away . It is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with . As to its being a disorganised city , if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there , who knows the city and the business , of old , and is in Tellson's confidence . As to the uncertain travelling , the long journey , and the winter weather , if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's , after all these years , who ought to be ? 
 I wish I were going myself , said Charles Darnay , somewhat restlessly , and like one thinking aloud . 
 Indeed ! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise ! exclaimed Mr . Lorry . You wish you were going yourself ? And you a Frenchman born ? You are a wise counsellor . 
 My dear Mr . Lorry , it is because I am a Frenchman born , that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here , however) has passed through my mind often . One cannot help thinking , having had some sympathy for the miserable people , and having abandoned something to them , he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner , that one might be listened to , and might have the power to persuade to some restraint . Only last night , after you had left us , when I was talking to Lucie
 When you were talking to Lucie , Mr . Lorry repeated . Yes . I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie ! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day ! 
 However , I am not going , said Charles Darnay , with a smile . It is more to the purpose that you say you are . 
 And I am , in plain reality . The truth is , my dear Charles , Mr . Lorry glanced at the distant House , and lowered his voice , you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted , and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved . The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of our documents were seized or destroyed ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day , or sacked to-morrow ! Now , a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay , and the burying of them , or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way , is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself , if any one . And shall I hang back , when Tellson's knows this and says thisTellson's , whose bread I have eaten these sixty yearsbecause I am a little stiff about the joints ? Why , I am a boy , sir , to half a dozen old codgers here ! 
 How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit , Mr . Lorry . 
 Tut ! Nonsense , sir ! And , my dear Charles , said Mr . Lorry , glancing at the House again , you are to remember , that getting things out of Paris at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility . Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence ; it is not business-like to whisper it , even to you) , by the strangest bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers . At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in business-like Old England ; but now , everything is stopped . 
 And do you really go to-night ? 
 I really go to-night , for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay . 
 And do you take no one with you ? 
 All sorts of people have been proposed to me , but I will have nothing to say to any of them . I intend to take Jerry . Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him . Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog , or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master . 
 I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness . 
 I must say again , nonsense , nonsense ! When I have executed this little commission , I shall , perhaps , accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease . Time enough , then , to think about growing old . 
 This dialogue had taken place at Mr . Lorry's usual desk , with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it , boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long . It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee , and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy , to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sownas if nothing had ever been done , or omitted to be done , that had led to itas if observers of the wretched millions in France , and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous , had not seen it inevitably coming , years before , and had not in plain words recorded what they saw . Such vapouring , combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth . And it was such vapouring all about his ears , like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to a latent uneasiness in his mind , which had already made Charles Darnay restless , and which still kept him so . 
 Among the talkers , was Stryver , of the King's Bench Bar , far on his way to state promotion , and , therefore , loud on the theme : broaching to Monseigneur , his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth , and doing without them : and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race . Him , Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection ; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more , and remaining to interpose his word , when the thing that was to be , went on to shape itself out . 
 The House approached Mr . Lorry , and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him , asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed ? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the directionthe more quickly because it was his own right name . The address , turned into English , ran : 
 Very pressing . To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St . Evremonde , of France . Confided to the cares of Messrs . Tellson and Co . , Bankers , London , England . 
 On the marriage morning , Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay , that the secret of this name should beunless he , the Doctor , dissolved the obligationkept inviolate between them . Nobody else knew it to be his name ; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact ; Mr . Lorry could have none . 
 No , said Mr . Lorry , in reply to the House ; I have referred it , I think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found . 
 The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank , there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr . Lorry's desk . He held the letter out inquiringly ; and Monseigneur looked at it , in the person of this plotting and indignant refugee ; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee ; and This , That , and The Other , all had something disparaging to say , in French or in English , concerning the Marquis who was not to be found . 
 Nephew , I believebut in any case degenerate successorof the polished Marquis who was murdered , said one . Happy to say , I never knew him . 
 A craven who abandoned his post , said anotherthis Monseigneur had been got out of Paris , legs uppermost and half suffocated , in a load of haysome years ago . 
 Infected with the new doctrines , said a third , eyeing the direction through his glass in passing ; set himself in opposition to the last Marquis , abandoned the estates when he inherited them , and left them to the ruffian herd . They will recompense him now , I hope , as he deserves . 
 Hey ? cried the blatant Stryver . Did he though ? Is that the sort of fellow ? Let us look at his infamous name . Dn the fellow ! 
 Darnay , unable to restrain himself any longer , touched Mr . Stryver on the shoulder , and said : 
 I know the fellow . 
 Do you , by Jupiter ? said Stryver . I am sorry for it . 
 Why ? 
 Why , Mr . Darnay ? D'ye hear what he did ? Don't ask , why , in these times . 
 But I do ask why ? 
 Then I tell you again , Mr . Darnay , I am sorry for it . I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions . Here is a fellow , who , infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known , abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale , and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him ? Well , but I'll answer you . I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel . That's why . 
 Mindful of the secret , Darnay with great difficulty checked himself , and said : You may not understand the gentleman . 
 I understand how to put YOU in a corner , Mr . Darnay , said Bully Stryver , and I'll do it . If this fellow is a gentleman , I DON'T understand him . You may tell him so , with my compliments . You may also tell him , from me , that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them . But , no , gentlemen , said Stryver , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , I know something of human nature , and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow , trusting himself to the mercies of such precious PROTEGES . No , gentlemen ; he'll always show ëem a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and sneak away . 
 With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , Mr . Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street , amidst the general approbation of his hearers . Mr . Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk , in the general departure from the Bank . 
 Will you take charge of the letter ? said Mr . Lorry . You know where to deliver it ? 
 I do . 
 Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time ? 
 I will do so . Do you start for Paris from here ? 
 From here , at eight . 
 I will come back , to see you off . 
 Very ill at ease with himself , and with Stryver and most other men , Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple , opened the letter , and read it . These were its contents : 
 Prison of the Abbaye , Paris . 
 June 21 , 1792 . 
 MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS . 
 After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village , I have been seized , with great violence and indignity , and brought a long journey on foot to Paris . On the road I have suffered a great deal . Nor is that all ; my house has been destroyedrazed to the ground . 
 The crime for which I am imprisoned , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal , and shall lose my life (without your so generous help) , is , they tell me , treason against the majesty of the people , in that I have acted against them for an emigrant . It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them , and not against , according to your commands . It is in vain I represent that , before the sequestration of emigrant property , I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay ; that I had collected no rent ; that I had had recourse to no process . The only response is , that I have acted for an emigrant , and where is that emigrant ? 
 Ah ! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , where is that emigrant ? I cry in my sleep where is he ? I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me ? No answer . Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris ! 
 For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name , I supplicate you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , to succour and release me . My fault is , that I have been true to you . Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , I pray you be you true to me ! 
 From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , Monsieur heretofore the Marquis , the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service . 
 Your afflicted , 
 Gabelle . 
 The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter . The peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do , he almost hid his face from the passersby . 
 He knew very well , that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his resentful suspicions of his uncle , and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold , he had acted imperfectly . He knew very well , that in his love for Lucie , his renunciation of his social place , though by no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete . He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it , and that he had meant to do it , and that it had never been done . 
 The happiness of his own chosen English home , the necessity of being always actively employed , the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast , that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week , and the events of the week following made all new again ; he knew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded : not without disquiet , but still without continuous and accumulating resistance . That he had watched the times for a time of action , and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by , and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway , and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction , and their very names were blotting out , was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it . 
 But , he had oppressed no man , he had imprisoned no man ; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues , that he had relinquished them of his own will , thrown himself on a world with no favour in it , won his own private place there , and earned his own bread . Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to givesuch fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summerand no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof , for his own safety , so that it could not but appear now . 
 This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make , that he would go to Paris . 
 Yes . Like the mariner in the old story , the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go . Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster and faster , more and more steadily , to the terrible attraction . His latent uneasiness had been , that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay bloodshed , and assert the claims of mercy and humanity . With this uneasiness half stifled , and half reproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur , which had stung him bitterly , and those of Stryver , which above all were coarse and galling , for old reasons . Upon those , had followed Gabelle's letter : the appeal of an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and good name . 
 His resolution was made . He must go to Paris . 
 Yes . The Loadstone Rock was drawing him , and he must sail on , until he struck . He knew of no rock ; he saw hardly any danger . The intention with which he had done what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it . Then , that glorious vision of doing good , which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds , arose before him , and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild . 
 As he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone . Lucie should be spared the pain of separation ; and her father , always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as a step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt . How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father , through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind , he did not discuss with himself . But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course . 
 He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr . Lorry . As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now . 
 A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door , and Jerry was booted and equipped . 
 I have delivered that letter , said Charles Darnay to Mr . Lorry . I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a verbal one ? 
 That I will , and readily , said Mr . Lorry , if it is not dangerous . 
 Not at all . Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye . 
 What is his name ? said Mr . Lorry , with his open pocket-book in his hand . 
 Gabelle . 
 Gabelle . And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison ? 
 Simply , ëthat he has received the letter , and will come . '
 Any time mentioned ? 
 He will start upon his journey to-morrow night . 
 Any person mentioned ? 
 No . 
 He helped Mr . Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks , and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank , into the misty air of Fleet-street . My love to Lucie , and to little Lucie , said Mr . Lorry at parting , and take precious care of them till I come back . Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away . 
 That nightit was the fourteenth of Augusthe sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to Lucie , explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the Doctor , confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances . To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival . 
 It was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind . It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious . But , an affectionate glance at his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid) , and the day passed quickly . Early in the evening he embraced her , and her scarcely less dear namesake , pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an imaginary engagement took him out , and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready) , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets , with a heavier heart . 
 The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it . He left his two letters with a trusty porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for Dover ; and began his journey . For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name ! was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and floated away for the Loadstone Rock . 
 The end of the second book . 
 The traveller fared slowly on his way , who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two . More than enough of bad roads , bad equipages , and bad horses , he would have encountered to delay him , though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory ; but , the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these . Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots , with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness , who stopped all comers and goers , cross-questioned them , inspected their papers , looked for their names in lists of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible , of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death . 
 A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished , when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris . Whatever might befall now , he must on to his journey's end . Not a mean village closed upon him , not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England . The universal watchfulness so encompassed him , that if he had been taken in a net , or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone . 
 This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage , but retarded his progress twenty times in a day , by riding after him and taking him back , riding before him and stopping him by anticipation , riding with him and keeping him in charge . He had been days upon his journey in France alone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still a long way from Paris . 
 Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far . His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis . And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning , in the middle of the night . 
 Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths , who sat down on the bed . 
 Emigrant , said the functionary , I am going to send you on to Paris , under an escort . 
 Citizen , I desire nothing more than to get to Paris , though I could dispense with the escort . 
 Silence ! growled a red-cap , striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket . Peace , aristocrat ! 
 It is as the good patriot says , observed the timid functionary . You are an aristocrat , and must have an escortand must pay for it . 
 I have no choice , said Charles Darnay . 
 Choice ! Listen to him ! cried the same scowling red-cap . As if it was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron ! 
 It is always as the good patriot says , observed the functionary . Rise and dress yourself , emigrant . 
 Darnay complied , and was taken back to the guard-house , where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by a watch-fire . Here he paid a heavy price for his escort , and hence he started with it on the wet , wet roads at three o'clock in the morning . 
 The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades , armed with national muskets and sabres , who rode one on either side of him . 
 The escorted governed his own horse , but a loose line was attached to his bridle , the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist . In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces : clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon the mire-deep roads . In this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital . 
 They travelled in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lying by until the twilight fell . The escort were so wretchedly clothed , that they twisted straw round their bare legs , and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off . Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended , and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk , and carrying his musket very recklessly , Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and of representations , confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye , that were not yet made . 
 But when they came to the town of Beauvaiswhich they did at eventide , when the streets were filled with peoplehe could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming . An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard , and many voices called out loudly , Down with the emigrant ! 
 He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle , and , resuming it as his safest place , said : 
 Emigrant , my friends ! Do you not see me here , in France , of my own will ? 
 You are a cursed emigrant , cried a farrier , making at him in a furious manner through the press , hammer in hand ; and you are a cursed aristocrat ! 
 The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's bridle (at which he was evidently making) , and soothingly said , Let him be ; let him be ! He will be judged at Paris . 
 Judged ! repeated the farrier , swinging his hammer . Ay ! and condemned as a traitor . At this the crowd roared approval . 
 Checking the postmaster , who was for turning his horse's head to the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on , with the line round his wrist) , Darnay said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : 
 Friends , you deceive yourselves , or you are deceived . I am not a traitor . 
 He lies ! cried the smith . He is a traitor since the decree . His life is forfeit to the people . His cursed life is not his own ! 
 At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which another instant would have brought upon him , the postmaster turned his horse into the yard , the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks , and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates . The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer , and the crowd groaned ; but , no more was done . 
 What is this decree that the smith spoke of ? Darnay asked the postmaster , when he had thanked him , and stood beside him in the yard . 
 Truly , a decree for selling the property of emigrants . 
 When passed ? 
 On the fourteenth . 
 The day I left England ! 
 Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be othersif there are not alreadybanishing all emigrants , and condemning all to death who return . That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own . 
 But there are no such decrees yet ? 
 What do I know ! said the postmaster , shrugging his shoulders ; there may be , or there will be . It is all the same . What would you have ? 
 They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night , and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep . Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal , not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep . After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads , they would come to a cluster of poor cottages , not steeped in darkness , but all glittering with lights , and would find the people , in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night , circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty , or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song . Happily , however , there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the untimely cold and wet , among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year , diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade , and sharp reining up across their way , of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads . 
 Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris . The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it . 
 Where are the papers of this prisoner ? demanded a resolute-looking man in authority , who was summoned out by the guard . 
 Naturally struck by the disagreeable word , Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen , in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him , and which he had paid for . 
 Where , repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , are the papers of this prisoner ? 
 The drunken patriot had them in his cap , and produced them . Casting his eyes over Gabelle's letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise , and looked at Darnay with a close attention . 
 He left escort and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into the guard-room ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate . Looking about him while in this state of suspense , Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots , the latter far outnumbering the former ; and that while ingress into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies , and for similar traffic and traffickers , was easy enough , egress , even for the homeliest people , was very difficult . A numerous medley of men and women , not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts , was waiting to issue forth ; but , the previous identification was so strict , that they filtered through the barrier very slowly . Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke , while others talked together , or loitered about . The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal , both among men and women . 
 When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour , taking note of these things , Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open the barrier . Then he delivered to the escort , drunk and sober , a receipt for the escorted , and requested him to dismount . He did so , and the two patriots , leading his tired horse , turned and rode away without entering the city . 
 He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room , smelling of common wine and tobacco , where certain soldiers and patriots , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking , drunkenness and sobriety , were standing and lying about . The light in the guard-house , half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in a correspondingly uncertain condition . Some registers were lying open on a desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these . 
 Citizen Defarge , said he to Darnay's conductor , as he took a slip of paper to write on . Is this the emigrant Evremonde ? 
 This is the man . 
 Your age , Evremonde ? 
 Thirty-seven . 
 Married , Evremonde ? 
 Yes . 
 Where married ? 
 In England . 
 Without doubt . Where is your wife , Evremonde ? 
 In England . 
 Without doubt . You are consigned , Evremonde , to the prison of La Force . 
 Just Heaven ! exclaimed Darnay . Under what law , and for what offence ? 
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment . 
 We have new laws , Evremonde , and new offences , since you were here . He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing . 
 I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily , in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you . I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay . Is not that my right ? 
 Emigrants have no rights , Evremonde , was the stolid reply . The officer wrote until he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , sanded it , and handed it to Defarge , with the words In secret . 
 Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him . The prisoner obeyed , and a guard of two armed patriots attended them . 
 Is it you , said Defarge , in a low voice , as they went down the guardhouse steps and turned into Paris , who married the daughter of Doctor Manette , once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more ? 
 Yes , replied Darnay , looking at him with surprise . 
 My name is Defarge , and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint Antoine . Possibly you have heard of me . 
 My wife came to your house to reclaim her father ? Yes ! 
 The word wife seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge , to say with sudden impatience , In the name of that sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , why did you come to France ? 
 You heard me say why , a minute ago . Do you not believe it is the truth ? 
 A bad truth for you , said Defarge , speaking with knitted brows , and looking straight before him . 
 Indeed I am lost here . All here is so unprecedented , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that I am absolutely lost . Will you render me a little help ? 
 None . Defarge spoke , always looking straight before him . 
 Will you answer me a single question ? 
 Perhaps . According to its nature . You can say what it is . 
 In this prison that I am going to so unjustly , shall I have some free communication with the world outside ? 
 You will see . 
 I am not to be buried there , prejudged , and without any means of presenting my case ? 
 You will see . But , what then ? Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons , before now . 
 But never by me , Citizen Defarge . 
 Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in a steady and set silence . The deeper he sank into this silence , the fainter hope there wasor so Darnay thoughtof his softening in any slight degree . He , therefore , made haste to say : 
 It is of the utmost importance to me (you know , Citizen , even better than I , of how much importance) , that I should be able to communicate to Mr . Lorry of Tellson's Bank , an English gentleman who is now in Paris , the simple fact , without comment , that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force . Will you cause that to be done for me ? 
 I will do , Defarge doggedly rejoined , nothing for you . My duty is to my country and the People . I am the sworn servant of both , against you . I will do nothing for you . 
 Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further , and his pride was touched besides . As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets . The very children scarcely noticed him . A few passers turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat ; otherwise , that a man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work . In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited orator , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the royal family . The few words that he caught from this man's lips , first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison , and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris . On the road (except at Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing . The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him . 
 That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now . That perils had thickened about him fast , and might thicken faster and faster yet , he of course knew now . He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have foreseen the events of a few days . And yet his misgivings were not so dark as , imagined by the light of this later time , they would appear . Troubled as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope . The horrible massacre , days and nights long , which , within a few rounds of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away . The sharp female newly-born , and called La Guillotine , was hardly known to him , or to the generality of people , by name . The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers . How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind ? 
 Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he foreshadowed the likelihood , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly . With this on his mind , which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard , he arrived at the prison of La Force . 
 A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket , to whom Defarge presented The Emigrant Evremonde . 
 What the Devil ! How many more of them ! exclaimed the man with the bloated face . 
 Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , with his two fellow-patriots . 
 What the Devil , I say again ! exclaimed the gaoler , left with his wife . How many more ! 
 The gaoler's wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merely replied , One must have patience , my dear ! Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang , echoed the sentiment , and one added , For the love of Liberty ; which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion . 
 The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it . Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep , becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for ! 
 In secret , too , grumbled the gaoler , looking at the written paper . As if I was not already full to bursting ! 
 He stuck the paper on a file , in an ill-humour , and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in the strong arched room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates . 
 Come ! said the chief , at length taking up his keys , come with me , emigrant . 
 Through the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase , many doors clanging and locking behind them , until they came into a large , low , vaulted chamber , crowded with prisoners of both sexes . The women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , knitting , sewing , and embroidering ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs or lingering up and down the room . 
 In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace , the new-comer recoiled from this company . But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every refinement of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life . 
 So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom , so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen , that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead . Ghosts all ! The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of frivolity , the ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there . 
 It struck him motionless . The gaoler standing at his side , and the other gaolers moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions , looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were therewith the apparitions of the coquette , the young beauty , and the mature woman delicately bredthat the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented , was heightened to its utmost . Surely , ghosts all . Surely , the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades ! 
 In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune , said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address , coming forward , I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force , and of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us . May it soon terminate happily ! It would be an impertinence elsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ? 
 Charles Darnay roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as suitable as he could find . 
 But I hope , said the gentleman , following the chief gaoler with his eyes , who moved across the room , that you are not in secret ? 
 I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so . 
 Ah , what a pity ! We so much regret it ! But take courage ; several members of our society have been in secret , at first , and it has lasted but a short time . Then he added , raising his voice , I grieve to inform the societyin secret . 
 There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him , and many voicesamong which , the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuousgave him good wishes and encouragement . He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the gaoler's hand ; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever . 
 The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward . When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them) , the gaoler opened a low black door , and they passed into a solitary cell . It struck cold and damp , but was not dark . 
 Yours , said the gaoler . 
 Why am I confined alone ? 
 How do I know ! 
 I can buy pen , ink , and paper ? 
 Such are not my orders . You will be visited , and can ask then . At present , you may buy your food , and nothing more . 
 There were in the cell , a chair , a table , and a straw mattress . As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before going out , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him , that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated , both in face and person , as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water . When the gaoler was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , Now am I left , as if I were dead . Stopping then , to look down at the mattress , he turned from it with a sick feeling , and thought , And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death . 
 Five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half . The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting its measurement , and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them . He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . The prisoner counted the measurement again , and paced faster , to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition . The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed . There was one among them , the appearance of a lady dressed in black , who was leaning in the embrasure of a window , and she had a light shining upon her golden hair , and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again , for God's sake , through the illuminated villages with the people all awake ! * * * * He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . * * * * Five paces by four and a half . With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of his mind , the prisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and the roar of the city changed to this extentthat it still rolled in like muffled drums , but with the wail of voices that he knew , in the swell that rose above them . Book Three : The Track of the Storm
 Tellson's Bank , established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris , was in a wing of a large house , approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate . The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles , in his own cook's dress , and got across the borders . A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters , he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur , the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question . 
 Monseigneur gone , and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated , and then confiscated . For , all things moved so fast , and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September , patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house , and had marked it with the tri-colour , and were drinking brandy in its state apartments . 
 A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris , would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette . For , what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard , and even to a Cupid over the counter ? Yet such things were . Tellson's had whitewashed the Cupid , but he was still to be seen on the ceiling , in the coolest linen , aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to night . Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan , in Lombard-street , London , and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy , and also of a looking-glass let into the wall , and also of clerks not at all old , who danced in public on the slightest provocation . Yet , a French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as the times held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out his money . 
 What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places , while the depositors rusted in prisons , and when they should have violently perished ; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , that night , any more than Mr . Jarvis Lorry could , though he thought heavily of these questions . He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold) , and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw , or any object in the room distortedly reflecta shade of horror . 
 He occupied rooms in the Bank , in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part , like strong root-ivy . It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that . All such circumstances were indifferent to him , so that he did his duty . On the opposite side of the courtyard , under a colonnade , was extensive standingfor carriageswhere , indeed , some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood . Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux , and in the light of these , standing out in the open air , was a large grindstone : a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy , or other workshop . Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects , Mr . Lorry shivered , and retired to his seat by the fire . He had opened , not only the glass window , but the lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and he shivered through his frame . 
 From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate , there came the usual night hum of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , weird and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven . 
 Thank God , said Mr . Lorry , clasping his hands , that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night . May He have mercy on all who are in danger ! 
 Soon afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , They have come back ! and sat listening . But , there was no loud irruption into the courtyard , as he had expected , and he heard the gate clash again , and all was quiet . 
 The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank , which a great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused . It was well guarded , and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figures rushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement . 
 Lucie and her father ! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him , and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified , that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life . 
 What is this ? cried Mr . Lorry , breathless and confused . What is the matter ? Lucie ! Manette ! What has happened ? What has brought you here ? What is it ? 
 With the look fixed upon him , in her paleness and wildness , she panted out in his arms , imploringly , O my dear friend ! My husband ! 
 Your husband , Lucie ? 
 Charles . 
 What of Charles ? 
 Here . 
 Here , in Paris ? 
 Has been here some daysthree or fourI don't know how manyI can't collect my thoughts . An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the barrier , and sent to prison . 
 The old man uttered an irrepressible cry . Almost at the same moment , the beg of the great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard . 
 What is that noise ? said the Doctor , turning towards the window . 
 Don't look ! cried Mr . Lorry . Don't look out ! Manette , for your life , don't touch the blind ! 
 The Doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with a cool , bold smile : 
 My dear friend , I have a charmed life in this city . I have been a Bastille prisoner . There is no patriot in Parisin Paris ? In Francewho , knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille , would touch me , except to overwhelm me with embraces , or carry me in triumph . My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier , and gained us news of Charles there , and brought us here . I knew it would be so ; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger ; I told Lucie so . What is that noise ? His hand was again upon the window . 
 Don't look ! cried Mr . Lorry , absolutely desperate . No , Lucie , my dear , nor you ! He got his arm round her , and held her . Don't be so terrified , my love . I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles ; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place . What prison is he in ? 
 La Force ! 
 La Force ! Lucie , my child , if ever you were brave and serviceable in your lifeand you were always bothyou will compose yourself now , to do exactly as I bid you ; for more depends upon it than you can think , or I can say . There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night ; you cannot possibly stir out . I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake , is the hardest thing to do of all . You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet . You must let me put you in a room at the back here . You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay . 
 I will be submissive to you . I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this . I know you are true . 
 The old man kissed her , and hurried her into his room , and turned the key ; then , came hurrying back to the Doctor , and opened the window and partly opened the blind , and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm , and looked out with him into the courtyard . 
 Looked out upon a throng of men and women : not enough in number , or near enough , to fill the courtyard : not more than forty or fifty in all . The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate , and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone ; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose , as in a convenient and retired spot . 
 But , such awful workers , and such awful work ! 
 The grindstone had a double handle , and , turning at it madly were two men , whose faces , as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up , were more horrible and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise . False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty , and all awry with howling , and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep . As these ruffians turned and turned , their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes , now flung backward over their necks , some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink ; and what with dropping blood , and what with dropping wine , and what with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone , all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire . The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from the smear of blood . Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone , were men stripped to the waist , with the stain all over their limbs and bodies ; men in all sorts of rags , with the stain upon those rags ; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon , with the stain dyeing those trifles through and through . Hatchets , knives , bayonets , swords , all brought to be sharpened , were all red with it . Some of the hacked swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them , with strips of linen and fragments of dress : ligatures various in kind , but all deep of the one colour . And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets , the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes ; eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life , to petrify with a well-directed gun . 
 All this was seen in a moment , as the vision of a drowning man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see a world if it were there . They drew back from the window , and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend's ashy face . 
 They are , Mr . Lorry whispered the words , glancing fearfully round at the locked room , murdering the prisoners . If you are sure of what you say ; if you really have the power you think you haveas I believe you havemake yourself known to these devils , and get taken to La Force . It may be too late , I don't know , but let it not be a minute later ! 
 Doctor Manette pressed his hand , hastened bareheaded out of the room , and was in the courtyard when Mr . Lorry regained the blind . 
 His streaming white hair , his remarkable face , and the impetuous confidence of his manner , as he put the weapons aside like water , carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone . For a few moments there was a pause , and a hurry , and a murmur , and the unintelligible sound of his voice ; and then Mr . Lorry saw him , surrounded by all , and in the midst of a line of twenty men long , all linked shoulder to shoulder , and hand to shoulder , hurried out with cries ofLive the Bastille prisoner ! Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force ! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there ! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force ! and a thousand answering shouts . 
 He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart , closed the window and the curtain , hastened to Lucie , and told her that her father was assisted by the people , and gone in search of her husband . He found her child and Miss Pross with her ; but , it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards , when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew . 
 Lucie had , by that time , fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand . Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge . O the long , long night , with the moans of the poor wife ! And O the long , long night , with no return of her father and no tidings ! 
 Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded , and the irruption was repeated , and the grindstone whirled and spluttered . What is it ? cried Lucie , affrighted . Hush ! The soldiers' swords are sharpened there , said Mr . Lorry . The place is national property now , and used as a kind of armoury , my love . 
 Twice more in all ; but , the last spell of work was feeble and fitful . Soon afterwards the day began to dawn , and he softly detached himself from the clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again . A man , so besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain , was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone , and looking about him with a vacant air . Shortly , this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur , and , staggering to that gorgeous vehicle , climbed in at the door , and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions . 
 The great grindstone , Earth , had turned when Mr . Lorry looked out again , and the sun was red on the courtyard . But , the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away . 
 One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr . Lorry when business hours came round , was this : that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof . His own possessions , safety , life , he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child , without a moment's demur ; but the great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business . 
 At first , his mind reverted to Defarge , and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city . But , the same consideration that suggested him , repudiated him ; he lived in the most violent Quarter , and doubtless was influential there , and deep in its dangerous workings . 
 Noon coming , and the Doctor not returning , and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's , Mr . Lorry advised with Lucie . She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term , in that Quarter , near the Banking-house . As there was no business objection to this , and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles , and he were to be released , he could not hope to leave the city , Mr . Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging , and found a suitable one , high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes . 
 To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child , and Miss Pross : giving them what comfort he could , and much more than he had himself . He left Jerry with them , as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head , and retained to his own occupations . A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them , and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him . 
 It wore itself out , and wore him out with it , until the Bank closed . He was again alone in his room of the previous night , considering what to do next , when he heard a foot upon the stair . In a few moments , a man stood in his presence , who , with a keenly observant look at him , addressed him by his name . 
 Your servant , said Mr . Lorry . Do you know me ? 
 He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair , from forty-five to fifty years of age . For answer he repeated , without any change of emphasis , the words : 
 Do you know me ? 
 I have seen you somewhere . 
 Perhaps at my wine-shop ? 
 Much interested and agitated , Mr . Lorry said : You come from Doctor Manette ? 
 Yes . I come from Doctor Manette . 
 And what says he ? What does he send me ? 
 Defarge gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper . It bore the words in the Doctor's writing : 
 Charles is safe , but I cannot safely leave this place yet . I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife . Let the bearer see his wife . 
 It was dated from La Force , within an hour . 
 Will you accompany me , said Mr . Lorry , joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud , to where his wife resides ? 
 Yes , returned Defarge . 
 Scarcely noticing as yet , in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke , Mr . Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard . There , they found two women ; one , knitting . 
 Madame Defarge , surely ! said Mr . Lorry , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago . 
 It is she , observed her husband . 
 Does Madame go with us ? inquired Mr . Lorry , seeing that she moved as they moved . 
 Yes . That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons . It is for their safety . 
 Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner , Mr . Lorry looked dubiously at him , and led the way . Both the women followed ; the second woman being The Vengeance . 
 They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascended the staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by Jerry , and found Lucie weeping , alone . She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr . Lorry gave her of her husband , and clasped the hand that delivered his notelittle thinking what it had been doing near him in the night , and might , but for a chance , have done to him . 
 DEAREST , Take courage . I am well , and your father has influence around me . You cannot answer this . Kiss our child for me . 
 That was all the writing . It was so much , however , to her who received it , that she turned from Defarge to his wife , and kissed one of the hands that knitted . It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but the hand made no responsedropped cold and heavy , and took to its knitting again . 
 There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check . She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at Madame Defarge . Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , impassive stare . 
 My dear , said Mr . Lorry , striking in to explain ; there are frequent risings in the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times , to the end that she may know themthat she may identify them . I believe , said Mr . Lorry , rather halting in his reassuring words , as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , I state the case , Citizen Defarge ? 
 Defarge looked gloomily at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence . 
 You had better , Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , doing all he could to propitiate , by tone and manner , have the dear child here , and our good Pross . Our good Pross , Defarge , is an English lady , and knows no French . 
 The lady in question , whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner , was not to be shaken by distress and , danger , appeared with folded arms , and observed in English to The Vengeance , whom her eyes first encountered , Well , I am sure , Boldface ! I hope YOU are pretty well ! She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge ; but , neither of the two took much heed of her . 
 Is that his child ? said Madame Defarge , stopping in her work for the first time , and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate . 
 Yes , madame , answered Mr . Lorry ; this is our poor prisoner's darling daughter , and only child . 
 The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast . The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both the mother and the child . 
 It is enough , my husband , said Madame Defarge . I have seen them . We may go . 
 But , the suppressed manner had enough of menace in itnot visible and presented , but indistinct and withheldto alarm Lucie into saying , as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress : 
 You will be good to my poor husband . You will do him no harm . You will help me to see him if you can ? 
 Your husband is not my business here , returned Madame Defarge , looking down at her with perfect composure . It is the daughter of your father who is my business here . 
 For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband . For my child's sake ! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful . We are more afraid of you than of these others . 
 Madame Defarge received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband . Defarge , who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her , collected his face into a sterner expression . 
 What is it that your husband says in that little letter ? asked Madame Defarge , with a lowering smile . Influence ; he says something touching influence ? 
 That my father , said Lucie , hurriedly taking the paper from her breast , but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it , has much influence around him . 
 Surely it will release him ! said Madame Defarge . Let it do so . 
 As a wife and mother , cried Lucie , most earnestly , I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess , against my innocent husband , but to use it in his behalf . O sister-woman , think of me . As a wife and mother ! 
 Madame Defarge looked , coldly as ever , at the suppliant , and said , turning to her friend The Vengeance : 
 The wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little as this child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ? We have known THEIR husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ? All our lives , we have seen our sister-women suffer , in themselves and in their children , poverty , nakedness , hunger , thirst , sickness , misery , oppression and neglect of all kinds ? 
 We have seen nothing else , returned The Vengeance . 
 We have borne this a long time , said Madame Defarge , turning her eyes again upon Lucie . Judge you ! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now ? 
 She resumed her knitting and went out . The Vengeance followed . Defarge went last , and closed the door . 
 Courage , my dear Lucie , said Mr . Lorry , as he raised her . Courage , courage ! So far all goes well with usmuch , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls . Cheer up , and have a thankful heart . 
 I am not thankless , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes . 
 Tut , tut ! said Mr . Lorry ; what is this despondency in the brave little breast ? A shadow indeed ! No substance in it , Lucie . 
 But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly . 
 Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence . So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her , that not until long afterwards , when France and she were far apart , did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all ages had been killed by the populace ; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror ; and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain . She only knew that there had been an attack upon the prisons , that all political prisoners had been in danger , and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered . 
 To Mr . Lorry , the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell , that the crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force . That , in the prison he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting , before which the prisoners were brought singly , and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be massacred , or to be released , or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells . That , presented by his conductors to this Tribunal , he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him , and that this man was Defarge . 
 That , hereupon he had ascertained , through the registers on the table , that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners , and had pleaded hard to the Tribunalof whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murder and some clean , some sober and some notfor his life and liberty . That , in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system , it had been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court , and examined . That , he seemed on the point of being at once released , when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor) , which led to a few words of secret conference . That , the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody , but should , for his sake , be held inviolate in safe custody . That , immediately , on a signal , the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again ; but , that he , the Doctor , had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was , through no malice or mischance , delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings , that he had obtained the permission , and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over . 
 The sights he had seen there , with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals , shall remain untold . The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved , had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces . One prisoner there was , he said , who had been discharged into the street free , but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out . Being besought to go to him and dress the wound , the Doctor had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans , who were seated on the bodies of their victims . With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare , they had helped the healer , and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitudehad made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spothad then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful , that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands , and swooned away in the midst of it . 
 As Mr . Lorry received these confidences , and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age , a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger . 
 But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character . For the first time the Doctor felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power . For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter's husband , and deliver him . It all tended to a good end , my friend ; it was not mere waste and ruin . As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself , I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her ; by the aid of Heaven I will do it ! Thus , Doctor Manette . And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes , the resolute face , the calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like a clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness , he believed . 
 Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his persevering purpose . While he kept himself in his place , as a physician , whose business was with all degrees of mankind , bond and free , rich and poor , bad and good , he used his personal influence so wisely , that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons , and among them of La Force . He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone , but was mixed with the general body of prisoners ; he saw her husband weekly , and brought sweet messages to her , straight from his lips ; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand) , but she was not permitted to write to him : for , among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons , the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad . 
 This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life , no doubt ; still , the sagacious Mr . Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it . Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride ; it was a natural and worthy one ; but he observed it as a curiosity . The Doctor knew , that up to that time , his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend , with his personal affliction , deprivation , and weakness . Now that this was changed , and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance , he became so far exalted by the change , that he took the lead and direction , and required them as the weak , to trust to him as the strong . The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed , yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them , for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him . All curious to see , thought Mr . Lorry , in his amiably shrewd way , but all natural and right ; so , take the lead , my dear friend , and keep it ; it couldn't be in better hands . 
 But , though the Doctor tried hard , and never ceased trying , to get Charles Darnay set at liberty , or at least to get him brought to trial , the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him . The new era began ; the king was tried , doomed , and beheaded ; the Republic of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , declared for victory or death against the world in arms ; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame ; three hundred thousand men , summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth , rose from all the varying soils of France , as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast , and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain , on rock , in gravel , and alluvial mud , under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North , in fell and forest , in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn , along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers , and in the sand of the sea-shore . What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Libertythe deluge rising from below , not falling from above , and with the windows of Heaven shut , not opened ! 
 There was no pause , no pity , no peace , no interval of relenting rest , no measurement of time . Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young , and the evening and morning were the first day , other count of time there was none . Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation , as it is in the fever of one patient . Now , breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city , the executioner showed the people the head of the kingand now , it seemed almost in the same breath , the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery , to turn it grey . 
 And yet , observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases , the time was long , while it flamed by so fast . A revolutionary tribunal in the capital , and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land ; a law of the Suspected , which struck away all security for liberty or life , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain no hearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things , and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old . Above all , one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the worldthe figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine . 
 It was the popular theme for jests ; it was the best cure for headache , it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey , it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion , it was the National Razor which shaved close : who kissed La Guillotine , looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack . It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race . It superseded the Cross . Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was discarded , and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied . 
 It sheared off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most polluted , were a rotten red . It was taken to pieces , like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil , and was put together again when the occasion wanted it . It hushed the eloquent , struck down the powerful , abolished the beautiful and good . Twenty-two friends of high public mark , twenty-one living and one dead , it had lopped the heads off , in one morning , in as many minutes . The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it ; but , so armed , he was stronger than his namesake , and blinder , and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day . 
 Among these terrors , and the brood belonging to them , the Doctor walked with a steady head : confident in his power , cautiously persistent in his end , never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last . Yet the current of the time swept by , so strong and deep , and carried the time away so fiercely , that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident . So much more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month , that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night , and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun . Still , the Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head . No man better known than he , in Paris at that day ; no man in a stranger situation . Silent , humane , indispensable in hospital and prison , using his art equally among assassins and victims , he was a man apart . In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men . He was not suspected or brought in question , any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before , or were a Spirit moving among mortals . 
 One year and three months . During all that time Lucie was never sure , from hour to hour , but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband's head next day . Every day , through the stony streets , the tumbrils now jolted heavily , filled with Condemned . Lovely girls ; bright women , brown-haired , black-haired , and grey ; youths ; stalwart men and old ; gentle born and peasant born ; all red wine for La Guillotine , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons , and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst . Liberty , equality , fraternity , or death ; the last , much the easiest to bestow , O Guillotine ! 
 If the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it would but have been with her as it was with many . But , from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine , she had been true to her duties . She was truest to them in the season of trial , as all the quietly loyal and good will always be . 
 As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations , she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there . Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time . Little Lucie she taught , as regularly , as if they had all been united in their English home . The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon be reunitedthe little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his booksthese , and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind . 
 She did not greatly alter in appearance . The plain dark dresses , akin to mourning dresses , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days . She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an occasional , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and comely . Sometimes , at night on kissing her father , she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day , and would say that her sole reliance , under Heaven , was on him . He always resolutely answered : Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge , and I know that I can save him , Lucie . 
 They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks , when her father said to her , on coming home one evening : 
 My dear , there is an upper window in the prison , to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon . When he can get to itwhich depends on many uncertainties and incidentshe might see you in the street , he thinks , if you stood in a certain place that I can show you . But you will not be able to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition . 
 O show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day . 
 From that time , in all weathers , she waited there two hours . As the clock struck two , she was there , and at four she turned resignedly away . When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed a single day . 
 It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street . The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning , was the only house at that end ; all else was wall . On the third day of her being there , he noticed her . 
 Good day , citizeness . 
 Good day , citizen . 
 This mode of address was now prescribed by decree . It had been established voluntarily some time ago , among the more thorough patriots ; but , was now law for everybody . 
 Walking here again , citizeness ? 
 You see me , citizen ! 
 The wood-sawyer , who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads) , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at the prison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars , peeped through them jocosely . 
 But it's not my business , said he . And went on sawing his wood . 
 Next day he was looking out for her , and accosted her the moment she appeared . 
 What ? Walking here again , citizeness ? 
 Yes , citizen . 
 Ah ! A child too ! Your mother , is it not , my little citizeness ? 
 Do I say yes , mamma ? whispered little Lucie , drawing close to her . 
 Yes , dearest . 
 Yes , citizen . 
 Ah ! But it's not my business . My work is my business . See my saw ! I call it my Little Guillotine . La , la , la ; La , la , la ! And off his head comes ! 
 The billet fell as he spoke , and he threw it into a basket . 
 I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine . See here again ! Loo , loo , loo ; Loo , loo , loo ! And off HER head comes ! Now , a child . Tickle , tickle ; Pickle , pickle ! And off ITS head comes . All the family ! 
 Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work , and not be in his sight . Thenceforth , to secure his good will , she always spoke to him first , and often gave him drink-money , which he readily received . 
 He was an inquisitive fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates , and in lifting her heart up to her husband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work . But it's not my business ! he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his sawing again . 
 In all weathers , in the snow and frost of winter , in the bitter winds of spring , in the hot sunshine of summer , in the rains of autumn , and again in the snow and frost of winter , Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place ; and every day on leaving it , she kissed the prison wall . Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times : it might be twice or thrice running : it might be , not for a week or a fortnight together . It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served , and on that possibility she would have waited out the day , seven days a week . 
 These occupations brought her round to the December month , wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head . On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner . It was a day of some wild rejoicing , and a festival . She had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with little pikes , and with little red caps stuck upon them ; also , with tricoloured ribbons ; also , with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite) , Republic One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
 The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small , that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend . He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him , however , who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty . On his house-top , he displayed pike and cap , as a good citizen must , and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his Little Sainte Guillotine for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised . His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to Lucie , and left her quite alone . 
 But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along , which filled her with fear . A moment afterwards , and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall , in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance . There could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand demons . There was no other music than their own singing . They danced to the popular Revolution song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison . Men and women danced together , women danced together , men danced together , as hazard had brought them together . At first , they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags ; but , as they filled the place , and stopped to dance about Lucie , some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them . They advanced , retreated , struck at one another's hands , clutched at one another's heads , spun round alone , caught one another and spun round in pairs , until many of them dropped . While those were down , the rest linked hand in hand , and all spun round together : then the ring broke , and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once , began again , struck , clutched , and tore , and then reversed the spin , and all spun round another way . Suddenly they stopped again , paused , struck out the time afresh , formed into lines the width of the public way , and , with their heads low down and their hands high up , swooped screaming off . No fight could have been half so terrible as this dance . It was so emphatically a fallen sporta something , once innocent , delivered over to all devilrya healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , and steeling the heart . Such grace as was visible in it , made it the uglier , showing how warped and perverted all things good by nature were become . The maidenly bosom bared to this , the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted , the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt , were types of the disjointed time . 
 This was the Carmagnole . As it passed , leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house , the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft , as if it had never been . 
 O my father ! for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand ; such a cruel , bad sight . 
 I know , my dear , I know . I have seen it many times . Don't be frightened ! Not one of them would harm you . 
 I am not frightened for myself , my father . But when I think of my husband , and the mercies of these people
 We will set him above their mercies very soon . I left him climbing to the window , and I came to tell you . There is no one here to see . You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof . 
 I do so , father , and I send him my Soul with it ! 
 You cannot see him , my poor dear ? 
 No , father , said Lucie , yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand , no . 
 A footstep in the snow . Madame Defarge . I salute you , citizeness , from the Doctor . I salute you , citizen . This in passing . Nothing more . Madame Defarge gone , like a shadow over the white road . 
 Give me your arm , my love . Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake . That was well done ; they had left the spot ; it shall not be in vain . Charles is summoned for to-morrow . 
 For to-morrow ! 
 There is no time to lose . I am well prepared , but there are precautions to be taken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal . He has not received the notice yet , but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow , and removed to the Conciergerie ; I have timely information . You are not afraid ? 
 She could scarcely answer , I trust in you . 
 Do so , implicitly . Your suspense is nearly ended , my darling ; he shall be restored to you within a few hours ; I have encompassed him with every protection . I must see Lorry . 
 He stopped . There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing . They both knew too well what it meant . One . Two . Three . Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow . 
 I must see Lorry , the Doctor repeated , turning her another way . 
 The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it . He and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated and made national . What he could save for the owners , he saved . No better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping , and to hold his peace . 
 A murky red and yellow sky , and a rising mist from the Seine , denoted the approach of darkness . It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank . The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted . Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court , ran the letters : National Property . Republic One and Indivisible . Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death ! 
 Who could that be with Mr . Lorrythe owner of the riding-coat upon the chairwho must not be seen ? From whom newly arrived , did he come out , agitated and surprised , to take his favourite in his arms ? To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued , he said : Removed to the Conciergerie , and summoned for to-morrow ? 
 The dread tribunal of five Judges , Public Prosecutor , and determined Jury , sat every day . Their lists went forth every evening , and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners . The standard gaoler-joke was , Come out and listen to the Evening Paper , you inside there ! 
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay ! 
 So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force . 
 When a name was called , its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded . Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , had reason to know the usage ; he had seen hundreds pass away so . 
 His bloated gaoler , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the list , making a similar short pause at each name . There were twenty-three names , but only twenty were responded to ; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten , and two had already been guillotined and forgotten . The list was read , in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival . Every one of those had perished in the massacre ; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with , had died on the scaffold . 
 There were hurried words of farewell and kindness , but the parting was soon over . It was the incident of every day , and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert , for that evening . They crowded to the grates and shed tears there ; but , twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled , and the time was , at best , short to the lock-up hour , when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night . The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling ; their ways arose out of the condition of the time . Similarly , though with a subtle difference , a species of fervour or intoxication , known , without doubt , to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily , and to die by it , was not mere boastfulness , but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind . In seasons of pestilence , some of us will have a secret attraction to the diseasea terrible passing inclination to die of it . And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts , only needing circumstances to evoke them . 
 The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark ; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold . Next day , fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called . All the fifteen were condemned , and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half . 
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was at length arraigned . 
 His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats ; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing . Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience , he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed , and that the felons were trying the honest men . The lowest , cruelest , and worst populace of a city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily commenting , applauding , disapproving , anticipating , and precipitating the result , without a check . Of the men , the greater part were armed in various ways ; of the women , some wore knives , some daggers , some ate and drank as they looked on , many knitted . Among these last , was one , with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked . She was in a front row , by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier , but whom he directly remembered as Defarge . He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear , and that she seemed to be his wife ; but , what he most noticed in the two figures was , that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be , they never looked towards him . They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination , and they looked at the Jury , but at nothing else . Under the President sat Doctor Manette , in his usual quiet dress . As well as the prisoner could see , he and Mr . Lorry were the only men there , unconnected with the Tribunal , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole . 
 Charles Evremonde , called Darnay , was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant , whose life was forfeit to the Republic , under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death . It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France . There he was , and there was the decree ; he had been taken in France , and his head was demanded . 
 Take off his head ! cried the audience . An enemy to the Republic ! 
 The President rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England ? 
 Undoubtedly it was . 
 Was he not an emigrant then ? What did he call himself ? 
 Not an emigrant , he hoped , within the sense and spirit of the law . 
 Why not ? the President desired to know . 
 Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him , and a station that was distasteful to him , and had left his countryhe submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in useto live by his own industry in England , rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France . 
 What proof had he of this ? 
 He handed in the names of two witnesses ; Theophile Gabelle , and Alexandre Manette . 
 But he had married in England ? the President reminded him . 
 True , but not an English woman . 
 A citizeness of France ? 
 Yes . By birth . 
 Her name and family ? 
 Lucie Manette , only daughter of Doctor Manette , the good physician who sits there . 
 This answer had a happy effect upon the audience . Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall . So capriciously were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before , as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him . 
 On these few steps of his dangerous way , Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions . The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him , and had prepared every inch of his road . 
 The President asked , why had he returned to France when he did , and not sooner ? 
 He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in France , save those he had resigned ; whereas , in England , he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature . He had returned when he did , on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen , who represented that his life was endangered by his absence . He had come back , to save a citizen's life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth . Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic ? 
 The populace cried enthusiastically , No ! and the President rang his bell to quiet them . Which it did not , for they continued to cry No ! until they left off , of their own will . 
 The President required the name of that citizen . The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness . He also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter , which had been taken from him at the Barrier , but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President . 
 The Doctor had taken care that it should be therehad assured him that it would be thereand at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read . Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it , and did so . Citizen Gabelle hinted , with infinite delicacy and politeness , that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal , he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbayein fact , had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembranceuntil three days ago ; when he had been summoned before it , and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered , as to himself , by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde , called Darnay . 
 Doctor Manette was next questioned . His high personal popularity , and the clearness of his answers , made a great impression ; but , as he proceeded , as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment ; that , the accused had remained in England , always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile ; that , so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there , he had actually been tried for his life by it , as the foe of England and friend of the United Statesas he brought these circumstances into view , with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness , the Jury and the populace became one . At last , when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry , an English gentleman then and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it , the Jury declared that they had heard enough , and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them . 
 At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually) , the populace set up a shout of applause . All the voices were in the prisoner's favour , and the President declared him free . 
 Then , began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness , or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy , or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen account of cruel rage . No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable ; it is probable , to a blending of all the three , with the second predominating . No sooner was the acquittal pronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at him with the very same intensity , to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets . 
 His removal , to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these caresses for the moment . Five were to be tried together , next , as enemies of the Republic , forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed . So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost , that these five came down to him before he left the place , condemned to die within twenty-four hours . The first of them told him so , with the customary prison sign of Deatha raised fingerand they all added in words , Long live the Republic ! 
 The five had had , it is true , no audience to lengthen their proceedings , for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate , there was a great crowd about it , in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Courtexcept two , for which he looked in vain . On his coming out , the concourse made at him anew , weeping , embracing , and shouting , all by turns and all together , until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted , seemed to run mad , like the people on the shore . 
 They put him into a great chair they had among them , and which they had taken either out of the Court itself , or one of its rooms or passages . Over the chair they had thrown a red flag , and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top . In this car of triumph , not even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men's shoulders , with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him , and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces , that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion , and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine . 
 In wild dreamlike procession , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on . Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour , in winding and tramping through them , as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye , they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived . Her father had gone on before , to prepare her , and when her husband stood upon his feet , she dropped insensible in his arms . 
 As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd , so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen , a few of the people fell to dancing . Instantly , all the rest fell to dancing , and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole . Then , they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty , and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets , and along the river's bank , and over the bridge , the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away . 
 After grasping the Doctor's hand , as he stood victorious and proud before him ; after grasping the hand of Mr . Lorry , who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole ; after kissing little Lucie , who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck ; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her ; he took his wife in his arms , and carried her up to their rooms . 
 Lucie ! My own ! I am safe . 
 O dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him . 
 They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts . When she was again in his arms , he said to her : 
 And now speak to your father , dearest . No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me . 
 She laid her head upon her father's breast , as she had laid his poor head on her own breast , long , long ago . He was happy in the return he had made her , he was recompensed for his suffering , he was proud of his strength . You must not be weak , my darling , he remonstrated ; don't tremble so . I have saved him . 
 I have saved him . It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back ; he was really here . And yet his wife trembled , and a vague but heavy fear was upon her . 
 All the air round was so thick and dark , the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful , the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice , it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her , every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched , that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be . The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall , and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets . Her mind pursued them , looking for him among the Condemned ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more . 
 Her father , cheering her , showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness , which was wonderful to see . No garret , no shoemaking , no One Hundred and Five , North Tower , now ! He had accomplished the task he had set himself , his promise was redeemed , he had saved Charles . Let them all lean upon him . 
 Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind : not only because that was the safest way of life , involving the least offence to the people , but because they were not rich , and Charles , throughout his imprisonment , had had to pay heavily for his bad food , and for his guard , and towards the living of the poorer prisoners . Partly on this account , and partly to avoid a domestic spy , they kept no servant ; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate , rendered them occasional service ; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr . Lorry) had become their daily retainer , and had his bed there every night . 
 It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty , Equality , Fraternity , or Death , that on the door or doorpost of every house , the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size , at a certain convenient height from the ground . Mr . Jerry Cruncher's name , therefore , duly embellished the doorpost down below ; and , as the afternoon shadows deepened , the owner of that name himself appeared , from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde , called Darnay . 
 In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time , all the usual harmless ways of life were changed . In the Doctor's little household , as in very many others , the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were purchased every evening , in small quantities and at various small shops . To avoid attracting notice , and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy , was the general desire . 
 For some months past , Miss Pross and Mr . Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors ; the former carrying the money ; the latter , the basket . Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they fared forth on this duty , and made and brought home such purchases as were needful . Although Miss Pross , through her long association with a French family , might have known as much of their language as of her own , if she had had a mind , she had no mind in that direction ; consequently she knew no more of that nonsense (as she was pleased to call it) than Mr . Cruncher did . So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any introduction in the nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of the thing she wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded . She always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as a statement of its just price , one finger less than the merchant held up , whatever his number might be . 
 Now , Mr . Cruncher , said Miss Pross , whose eyes were red with felicity ; if you are ready , I am . 
 Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service . He had worn all his rust off long ago , but nothing would file his spiky head down . 
 There's all manner of things wanted , said Miss Pross , and we shall have a precious time of it . We want wine , among the rest . Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking , wherever we buy it . 
 It will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , I should think , retorted Jerry , whether they drink your health or the Old Un's . 
 Who's he ? said Miss Pross . 
 Mr . Cruncher , with some diffidence , explained himself as meaning Old Nick's . 
 Ha ! said Miss Pross , it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures . They have but one , and it's Midnight Murder , and Mischief . 
 Hush , dear ! Pray , pray , be cautious ! cried Lucie . 
 Yes , yes , yes , I'll be cautious , said Miss Pross ; but I may say among ourselves , that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round , going on in the streets . Now , Ladybird , never you stir from that fire till I come back ! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered , and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now , till you see me again ! May I ask a question , Doctor Manette , before I go ? 
 I think you may take that liberty , the Doctor answered , smiling . 
 For gracious sake , don't talk about Liberty ; we have quite enough of that , said Miss Pross . 
 Hush , dear ! Again ? Lucie remonstrated . 
 Well , my sweet , said Miss Pross , nodding her head emphatically , the short and the long of it is , that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third ; Miss Pross curtseyed at the name ; and as such , my maxim is , Confound their politics , Frustrate their knavish tricks , On him our hopes we fix , God save the King ! 
 Mr . Cruncher , in an access of loyalty , growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross , like somebody at church . 
 I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you , though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice , said Miss Pross , approvingly . But the question , Doctor Manette . Is there it was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all , and to come at it in this chance manneris there any prospect yet , of our getting out of this place ? 
 I fear not yet . It would be dangerous for Charles yet . 
 Heigh-ho-hum ! said Miss Pross , cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire , then we must have patience and wait : that's all . We must hold up our heads and fight low , as my brother Solomon used to say . Now , Mr . Cruncher ! Don't you move , Ladybird ! 
 They went out , leaving Lucie , and her husband , her father , and the child , by a bright fire . Mr . Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House . Miss Pross had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed . Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm : and he , in a tone not rising much above a whisper , began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service . All was subdued and quiet , and Lucie was more at ease than she had been . 
 What is that ? she cried , all at once . 
 My dear ! said her father , stopping in his story , and laying his hand on hers , command yourself . What a disordered state you are in ! The least thingnothingstartles you ! YOU , your father's daughter ! 
 I thought , my father , said Lucie , excusing herself , with a pale face and in a faltering voice , that I heard strange feet upon the stairs . 
 My love , the staircase is as still as Death . As he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door . 
 Oh father , father . What can this be ! Hide Charles . Save him ! 
 My child , said the Doctor , rising , and laying his hand upon her shoulder , I HAVE saved him . What weakness is this , my dear ! Let me go to the door . 
 He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it . A rude clattering of feet over the floor , and four rough men in red caps , armed with sabres and pistols , entered the room . 
 The Citizen Evremonde , called Darnay , said the first . 
 Who seeks him ? answered Darnay . 
 I seek him . We seek him . I know you , Evremonde ; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day . You are again the prisoner of the Republic . 
 The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him . 
 Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner ? 
 It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie , and will know to-morrow . You are summoned for to-morrow . 
 Doctor Manette , whom this visitation had so turned into stone , that he stood with the lamp in his hand , as if be woe a statue made to hold it , moved after these words were spoken , put the lamp down , and confronting the speaker , and taking him , not ungently , by the loose front of his red woollen shirt , said : 
 You know him , you have said . Do you know me ? 
 Yes , I know you , Citizen Doctor . 
 We all know you , Citizen Doctor , said the other three . 
 He looked abstractedly from one to another , and said , in a lower voice , after a pause : 
 Will you answer his question to me then ? How does this happen ? 
 Citizen Doctor , said the first , reluctantly , he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine . This citizen , pointing out the second who had entered , is from Saint Antoine . 
 The citizen here indicated nodded his head , and added : 
 He is accused by Saint Antoine . 
 Of what ? asked the Doctor . 
 Citizen Doctor , said the first , with his former reluctance , ask no more . If the Republic demands sacrifices from you , without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them . The Republic goes before all . The People is supreme . Evremonde , we are pressed . 
 One word , the Doctor entreated . Will you tell me who denounced him ? 
 It is against rule , answered the first ; but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here . 
 The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man . Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : 
 Well ! Truly it is against rule . But he is denouncedand gravelyby the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge . And by one other . 
 What other ? 
 Do YOU ask , Citizen Doctor ? 
 Yes . 
 Then , said he of Saint Antoine , with a strange look , you will be answered to-morrow . Now , I am dumb ! 
 Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home , Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf , reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make . Mr . Cruncher , with the basket , walked at her side . They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed , had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people , and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers . It was a raw evening , and the misty river , blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked , making guns for the Army of the Republic . Woe to the man who played tricks with THAT Army , or got undeserved promotion in it ! Better for him that his beard had never grown , for the National Razor shaved him close . 
 Having purchased a few small articles of grocery , and a measure of oil for the lamp , Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted . After peeping into several wine-shops , she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , not far from the National Palace , once (and twice) the Tuileries , where the aspect of things rather took her fancy . It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed , and , though red with patriotic caps , was not so red as the rest . Sounding Mr . Cruncher , and finding him of her opinion , Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , attended by her cavalier . 
 Slightly observant of the smoky lights ; of the people , pipe in mouth , playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes ; of the one bare- breasted , bare-armed , soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud , and of the others listening to him ; of the weapons worn , or laid aside to be resumed ; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep , who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked , in that attitude , like slumbering bears or dogs ; the two outlandish customers approached the counter , and showed what they wanted . 
 As their wine was measuring out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart . In going , he had to face Miss Pross . No sooner did he face her , than Miss Pross uttered a scream , and clapped her hands . 
 In a moment , the whole company were on their feet . That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence . Everybody looked to see somebody fall , but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other ; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican ; the woman , evidently English . 
 What was said in this disappointing anti-climax , by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , except that it was something very voluble and loud , would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector , though they had been all ears . But , they had no ears for anything in their surprise . For , it must be recorded , that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation , but , Mr . Cruncherthough it seemed on his own separate and individual accountwas in a state of the greatest wonder . 
 What is the matter ? said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream ; speaking in a vexed , abrupt voice (though in a low tone) , and in English . 
 Oh , Solomon , dear Solomon ! cried Miss Pross , clapping her hands again . After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! 
 Don't call me Solomon . Do you want to be the death of me ? asked the man , in a furtive , frightened way . 
 Brother , brother ! cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears . Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question ? 
 Then hold your meddlesome tongue , said Solomon , and come out , if you want to speak to me . Pay for your wine , and come out . Who's this man ? 
 Miss Pross , shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother , said through her tears , Mr . Cruncher . 
 Let him come out too , said Solomon . Does he think me a ghost ? 
 Apparently , Mr . Cruncher did , to judge from his looks . He said not a word , however , and Miss Pross , exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine . As she did so , Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity , and offered a few words of explanation in the French language , which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits . 
 Now , said Solomon , stopping at the dark street corner , what do you want ? 
 How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from ! cried Miss Pross , to give me such a greeting , and show me no affection . 
 There . Confound it ! There , said Solomon , making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own . Now are you content ? 
 Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence . 
 If you expect me to be surprised , said her brother Solomon , I am not surprised ; I knew you were here ; I know of most people who are here . If you really don't want to endanger my existencewhich I half believe you dogo your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine . I am busy . I am an official . 
 My English brother Solomon , mourned Miss Pross , casting up her tear-fraught eyes , that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country , an official among foreigners , and such foreigners ! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his
 I said so ! cried her brother , interrupting . I knew it . You want to be the death of me . I shall be rendered Suspected , by my own sister . Just as I am getting on ! 
 The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid ! cried Miss Pross . Far rather would I never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall . Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us , and I will detain you no longer . 
 Good Miss Pross ! As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers . As if Mr . Lorry had not known it for a fact , years ago , in the quiet corner in Soho , that this precious brother had spent her money and left her ! 
 He was saying the affectionate word , however , with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case , all the world over) , when Mr . Cruncher , touching him on the shoulder , hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question : 
 I say ! Might I ask the favour ? As to whether your name is John Solomon , or Solomon John ? 
 The official turned towards him with sudden distrust . He had not previously uttered a word . 
 Come ! said Mr . Cruncher . Speak out , you know . (Which , by the way , was more than he could do himself . ) John Solomon , or Solomon John ? She calls you Solomon , and she must know , being your sister . And I know you're John , you know . Which of the two goes first ? And regarding that name of Pross , likewise . That warn't your name over the water . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Well , I don't know all I mean , for I can't call to mind what your name was , over the water . 
 No ? 
 No . But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables . 
 Indeed ? 
 Yes . T'other one's was one syllable . I know you . You was a spywitness at the Bailey . What , in the name of the Father of Lies , own father to yourself , was you called at that time ? 
 Barsad , said another voice , striking in . 
 That's the name for a thousand pound ! cried Jerry . 
 The speaker who struck in , was Sydney Carton . He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at Mr . Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself . 
 Don't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross . I arrived at Mr . Lorry's , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother . I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr . Barsad . I wish for your sake Mr . Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons . 
 Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers . The spy , who was pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared
 I'll tell you , said Sydney . I lighted on you , Mr . Barsad , coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls , an hour or more ago . You have a face to be remembered , and I remember faces well . Made curious by seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are no stranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate , I walked in your direction . I walked into the wine-shop here , close after you , and sat near you . I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation , and the rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling . And gradually , what I had done at random , seemed to shape itself into a purpose , Mr . Barsad . 
 What purpose ? the spy asked . 
 It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street . Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your companyat the office of Tellson's Bank , for instance ? 
 Under a threat ? 
 Oh ! Did I say that ? 
 Then , why should I go there ? 
 Really , Mr . Barsad , I can't say , if you can't . 
 Do you mean that you won't say , sir ? the spy irresolutely asked . 
 You apprehend me very clearly , Mr . Barsad . I won't . 
 Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill , in such a business as he had in his secret mind , and with such a man as he had to do with . His practised eye saw it , and made the most of it . 
 Now , I told you so , said the spy , casting a reproachful look at his sister ; if any trouble comes of this , it's your doing . 
 Come , come , Mr . Barsad ! exclaimed Sydney . Don't be ungrateful . But for my great respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction . Do you go with me to the Bank ? 
 I'll hear what you have got to say . Yes , I'll go with you . 
 I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street . Let me take your arm , Miss Pross . This is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your escort knows Mr . Barsad , I will invite him to Mr . Lorry's with us . Are we ready ? Come then ! 
 Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon , there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes , which not only contradicted his light manner , but changed and raised the man . She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection , and with Sydney's friendly reassurances , adequately to heed what she observed . 
 They left her at the corner of the street , and Carton led the way to Mr . Lorry's , which was within a few minutes' walk . John Barsad , or Solomon Pross , walked at his side . 
 Mr . Lorry had just finished his dinner , and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fireperhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's , who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover , now a good many years ago . He turned his head as they entered , and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger . 
 Miss Pross's brother , sir , said Sydney . Mr . Barsad . 
 Barsad ? repeated the old gentleman , Barsad ? I have an association with the nameand with the face . 
 I told you you had a remarkable face , Mr . Barsad , observed Carton , coolly . Pray sit down . 
 As he took a chair himself , he supplied the link that Mr . Lorry wanted , by saying to him with a frown , Witness at that trial . Mr . Lorry immediately remembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence . 
 Mr . Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of , said Sydney , and has acknowledged the relationship . I pass to worse news . Darnay has been arrested again . 
 Struck with consternation , the old gentleman exclaimed , What do you tell me ! I left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return to him ! 
 Arrested for all that . When was it done , Mr . Barsad ? 
 Just now , if at all . 
 Mr . Barsad is the best authority possible , sir , said Sydney , and I have it from Mr . Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine , that the arrest has taken place . He left the messengers at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter . There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken . 
 Mr . Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point . Confused , but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was silently attentive . 
 Now , I trust , said Sydney to him , that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrowyou said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow , Mr . Barsad ? 
 Yes ; I believe so . 
 In as good stead to-morrow as to-day . But it may not be so . I own to you , I am shaken , Mr . Lorry , by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest . 
 He may not have known of it beforehand , said Mr . Lorry . 
 But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law . 
 That's true , Mr . Lorry acknowledged , with his troubled hand at his chin , and his troubled eyes on Carton . 
 In short , said Sydney , this is a desperate time , when desperate games are played for desperate stakes . Let the Doctor play the winning game ; I will play the losing one . No man's life here is worth purchase . Any one carried home by the people to-day , may be condemned tomorrow . Now , the stake I have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the Conciergerie . And the friend I purpose to myself to win , is Mr . Barsad . 
 You need have good cards , sir , said the spy . 
 I'll run them over . I'll see what I hold , Mr . Lorry , you know what a brute I am ; I wish you'd give me a little brandy . 
 It was put before him , and he drank off a glassfuldrank off another glassfulpushed the bottle thoughtfully away . 
 Mr . Barsad , he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards : Sheep of the prisons , emissary of Republican committees , now turnkey , now prisoner , always spy and secret informer , so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman , represents himself to his employers under a false name . That's a very good card . Mr . Barsad , now in the employ of the republican French government , was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government , the enemy of France and freedom . That's an excellent card . Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion , that Mr . Barsad , still in the pay of the aristocratic English government , is the spy of Pitt , the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom , the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find . That's a card not to be beaten . Have you followed my hand , Mr . Barsad ? 
 Not to understand your play , returned the spy , somewhat uneasily . 
 I play my Ace , Denunciation of Mr . Barsad to the nearest Section Committee . Look over your hand , Mr . Barsad , and see what you have . Don't hurry . 
 He drew the bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank it off . He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him . Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful . 
 Look over your hand carefully , Mr . Barsad . Take time . 
 It was a poorer hand than he suspected . Mr . Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of . Thrown out of his honourable employment in England , through too much unsuccessful hard swearing therenot because he was not wanted there ; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern datehe knew that he had crossed the Channel , and accepted service in France : first , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there : gradually , as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives . He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop ; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment , release , and history , as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges ; and tried them on Madame Defarge , and had broken down with them signally . He always remembered with fear and trembling , that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her , and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved . He had since seen her , in the Section of Saint Antoine , over and over again produce her knitted registers , and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up . He knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe ; and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror , a word might bring it down upon him . Once denounced , and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind , he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs , would produce against him that fatal register , and would quash his last chance of life . Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over . 
 You scarcely seem to like your hand , said Sydney , with the greatest composure . Do you play ? 
 I think , sir , said the spy , in the meanest manner , as he turned to Mr . Lorry , I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it to this other gentleman , so much your junior , whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken . I admit that I am a spy , and that it is considered a discreditable stationthough it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one ? 
 I play my Ace , Mr . Barsad , said Carton , taking the answer on himself , and looking at his watch , without any scruple , in a very few minutes . 
 I should have hoped , gentlemen both , said the spy , always striving to hook Mr . Lorry into the discussion , that your respect for my sister
 I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , said Sydney Carton . 
 You think not , sir ? 
 I have thoroughly made up my mind about it . 
 The smooth manner of the spy , curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress , and probably with his usual demeanour , received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton , who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he , that it faltered here and failed him . While he was at a loss , Carton said , resuming his former air of contemplating cards : 
 And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet enumerated . That friend and fellow-Sheep , who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons ; who was he ? 
 French . You don't know him , said the spy , quickly . 
 French , eh ? repeated Carton , musing , and not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word . Well ; he may be . 
 Is , I assure you , said the spy ; though it's not important . 
 Though it's not important , repeated Carton , in the same mechanical waythough it's not importantNo , it's not important . No . Yet I know the face . 
 I think not . I am sure not . It can't be , said the spy . 
 It-can't-be , muttered Sydney Carton , retrospectively , and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again . Can't-be . Spoke good French . Yet like a foreigner , I thought ? 
 Provincial , said the spy . 
 No . Foreign ! cried Carton , striking his open hand on the table , as a light broke clearly on his mind . Cly ! Disguised , but the same man . We had that man before us at the Old Bailey . 
 Now , there you are hasty , sir , said Barsad , with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side ; there you really give me an advantage over you . Cly (who I will unreservedly admit , at this distance of time , was a partner of mine) has been dead several years . I attended him in his last illness . He was buried in London , at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields . His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains , but I helped to lay him in his coffin . 
 Here , Mr . Lorry became aware , from where he sat , of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall . Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr . Cruncher's head . 
 Let us be reasonable , said the spy , and let us be fair . To show you how mistaken you are , and what an unfounded assumption yours is , I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book , with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , ever since . There it is . Oh , look at it , look at it ! You may take it in your hand ; it's no forgery . 
 Here , Mr . Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate , and Mr . Cruncher rose and stepped forward . His hair could not have been more violently on end , if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built . 
 Unseen by the spy , Mr . Cruncher stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff . 
 That there Roger Cly , master , said Mr . Cruncher , with a taciturn and iron-bound visage . So YOU put him in his coffin ? 
 I did . 
 Who took him out of it ? 
 Barsad leaned back in his chair , and stammered , What do you mean ? 
 I mean , said Mr . Cruncher , that he warn't never in it . No ! Not he ! I'll have my head took off , if he was ever in it . 
 The spy looked round at the two gentlemen ; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry . 
 I tell you , said Jerry , that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin . Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly . It was a take in . Me and two more knows it . 
 How do you know it ? 
 What's that to you ? Ecod ! growled Mr . Cruncher , it's you I have got a old grudge again , is it , with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen ! I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . 
 Sydney Carton , who , with Mr . Lorry , had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business , here requested Mr . Cruncher to moderate and explain himself . 
 At another time , sir , he returned , evasively , the present time is ill-conwenient for explainin' . What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin . Let him say he was , in so much as a word of one syllable , and I'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea ; Mr . Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer ; or I'll out and announce him . 
 Humph ! I see one thing , said Carton . I hold another card , Mr . Barsad . Impossible , here in raging Paris , with Suspicion filling the air , for you to outlive denunciation , when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again ! A plot in the prisons , of the foreigner against the Republic . A strong carda certain Guillotine card ! Do you play ? 
 No ! returned the spy . I throw up . I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death , and that Cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham . Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me . 
 Never you trouble your head about this man , retorted the contentious Mr . Cruncher ; you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman . And look here ! Once more ! Mr . Cruncher could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his liberalityI'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea . 
 The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton , and said , with more decision , It has come to a point . I go on duty soon , and can't overstay my time . You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ? Now , it is of no use asking too much of me . Ask me to do anything in my office , putting my head in great extra danger , and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent . In short , I should make that choice . You talk of desperation . We are all desperate here . Remember ! I may denounce you if I think proper , and I can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others . Now , what do you want with me ? 
 Not very much . You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? 
 I tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , said the spy , firmly . 
 Why need you tell me what I have not asked ? You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie ? 
 I am sometimes . 
 You can be when you choose ? 
 I can pass in and out when I choose . 
 Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon the hearth , and watched it as it dropped . It being all spent , he said , rising : 
 So far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me . Come into the dark room here , and let us have one final word alone . 
 While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not a sound was heard , Mr . Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust . That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look , did not inspire confidence ; he changed the leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention ; and whenever Mr . Lorry's eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character . 
 Jerry , said Mr . Lorry . Come here . 
 Mr . Cruncher came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance of him . 
 What have you been , besides a messenger ? 
 After some cogitation , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , Mr . Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying , Agicultooral character . 
 My mind misgives me much , said Mr . Lorry , angrily shaking a forefinger at him , that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind , and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description . If you have , don't expect me to befriend you when you get back to England . If you have , don't expect me to keep your secret . Tellson's shall not be imposed upon . 
 I hope , sir , pleaded the abashed Mr . Cruncher , that a gentleman like yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it , would think twice about harming of me , even if it wos soI don't say it is , but even if it wos . And which it is to be took into account that if it wos , it wouldn't , even then , be all o' one side . There'd be two sides to it . There might be medical doctors at the present hour , a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his fardensfardens ! no , nor yet his half fardenshalf fardens ! no , nor yet his quartera banking away like smoke at Tellson's , and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly , a going in and going out to their own carriagesah ! Equally like smoke , if not more so . Well , that ëud be imposing , too , on Tellson's . For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander . And here's Mrs . Cruncher , or leastways wos in the Old England times , and would be to-morrow , if cause given , a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinatingstark ruinating ! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flopcatch ëem at it ! Or , if they flop , their toppings goes in favour of more patients , and how can you rightly have one without t'other ? Then , wot with undertakers , and wot with parish clerks , and wot with sextons , and wot with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it) , a man wouldn't get much by it , even if it wos so . And wot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , Mr . Lorry . He'd never have no good of it ; he'd want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once ineven if it wos so . 
 Ugh ! cried Mr . Lorry , rather relenting , nevertheless , I am shocked at the sight of you . 
 Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , pursued Mr . Cruncher , even if it wos so , which I don't say it is
 Don't prevaricate , said Mr . Lorry . 
 No , I will NOT , sir , returned Mr . Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or practicewhich I don't say it iswot I would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this . Upon that there stool , at that there Bar , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and growed up to be a man , wot will errand you , message you , general-light-job you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes . If it wos so , which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you , sir) , let that there boy keep his father's place , and take care of his mother ; don't blow upon that boy's fatherdo not do it , sirand let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin' , and make amends for what he would have undugif it wos soby diggin' of ëem in with a will , and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of ëem safe . That , Mr . Lorry , said Mr . Cruncher , wiping his forehead with his arm , as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse , is wot I would respectfully offer to you , sir . A man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him , in the way of Subjects without heads , dear me , plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that , without havin' his serious thoughts of things . And these here would be mine , if it wos so , entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now , I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep' it back . 
 That at least is true , said Mr . Lorry . Say no more now . It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in actionnot in words . I want no more words . 
 Mr . Cruncher knuckled his forehead , as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room . Adieu , Mr . Barsad , said the former ; our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me . 
 He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against Mr . Lorry . When they were alone , Mr . Lorry asked him what he had done ? 
 Not much . If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have ensured access to him , once . 
 Mr . Lorry's countenance fell . 
 It is all I could do , said Carton . To propose too much , would be to put this man's head under the axe , and , as he himself said , nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced . It was obviously the weakness of the position . There is no help for it . 
 But access to him , said Mr . Lorry , if it should go ill before the Tribunal , will not save him . 
 I never said it would . 
 Mr . Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest , gradually weakened them ; he was an old man now , overborne with anxiety of late , and his tears fell . 
 You are a good man and a true friend , said Carton , in an altered voice . Forgive me if I notice that you are affected . I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless . And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father . You are free from that misfortune , however . 
 Though he said the last words , with a slip into his usual manner , there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch , that Mr . Lorry , who had never seen the better side of him , was wholly unprepared for . He gave him his hand , and Carton gently pressed it . 
 To return to poor Darnay , said Carton . Don't tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement . It would not enable Her to go to see him . She might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence . 
 Mr . Lorry had not thought of that , and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind . It seemed to be ; he returned the look , and evidently understood it . 
 She might think a thousand things , Carton said , and any of them would only add to her trouble . Don't speak of me to her . As I said to you when I first came , I had better not see her . I can put my hand out , to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do , without that . You are going to her , I hope ? She must be very desolate to-night . 
 I am going now , directly . 
 I am glad of that . She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you . How does she look ? 
 Anxious and unhappy , but very beautiful . 
 Ah ! 
 It was a long , grieving sound , like a sighalmost like a sob . It attracted Mr . Lorry's eyes to Carton's face , which was turned to the fire . A light , or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which) , passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day , and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs , which was tumbling forward . He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots , then in vogue , and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale , with his long brown hair , all untrimmed , hanging loose about him . His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr . Lorry ; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log , when it had broken under the weight of his foot . 
 I forgot it , he said . 
 Mr . Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face . Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression . 
 And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ? said Carton , turning to him . 
 Yes . As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly , I have at length done all that I can do here . I hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted Paris . I have my Leave to Pass . I was ready to go .
