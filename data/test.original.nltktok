 Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused .
 This had been so very noticeable , so very powerfully and naturally shown , that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her .
 and the whisper went about , Who are they .
 Jerry , the messenger , who had made his own observations , in his own manner , and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption , stretched his neck to hear who they were .
 The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant , and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back .
 at last it got to Jerry : 
 Witnesses .
 Against .
 Against what side .
 The prisoner's .
 When the Attorney-General ceased , a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner , in anticipation of what he was soon to become .
 When toned down again , the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box .
 Had he ever been a spy himself .
 No , he scorned the base insinuation .
 What did he live upon .
 His property .
 Where was his property .
 He didn't precisely remember where it was .
 What was it .
 No business of anybody's .
 Had he inherited it .
 Yes , he had .
 From whom .
 Distant relation .
 Very distant .
 Rather .
 Ever been in prison .
 Certainly not .
 Never in a debtors' prison .
 Didn't see what that had to do with it .
 Never in a debtors' prison .
 Come , once again .
 Never .
 Yes .
 How many times .
 Two or three times .
 Not five or six .
 Perhaps .
 Of what profession .
 Gentleman .
 Ever been kicked .
 Might have been .
 Frequently .
 No .
 Ever kicked downstairs .
 Decidedly not .
 once received a kick on the top of a staircase , and fell downstairs of his own accord .
 Kicked on that occasion for cheating at dice .
 Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault , but it was not true .
 Swear it was not true .
 Positively .
 Ever live by cheating at play .
 Never .
 Ever live by play .
 Not more than other gentlemen do .
 Ever borrow money of the prisoner .
 Yes .
 Ever pay him .
 No .
 Was not this intimacy with the prisoner , in reality a very slight one , forced upon the prisoner in coaches , inns , and packets .
 No .
 Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists .
 Certain .
 Knew no more about the lists .
 No .
 Had not procured them himself , for instance .
 No .
 Expect to get anything by this evidence .
 No .
 Not in regular government pay and employment , to lay traps .
 Oh dear no .
 Or to do anything .
 Oh dear no .
 Swear that .
 Over and over again .
 No motives but motives of sheer patriotism .
 None whatever .
 The blue-flies buzzed again , and MrAttorney-General called MrJarvis Lorry .
 MrJarvis Lorry , are you a clerk in Tellson's bank .
 I am .
 On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five , did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail .
 It did .
 Were there any other passengers in the mail .
 Two .
 Did they alight on the road in the course of the night .
 They did .
 MrLorry , look upon the prisoner .
 Was he one of those two passengers .
 I cannot undertake to say that he was .
 Does he resemble either of these two passengers .
 Both were so wrapped up , and the night was so dark , and we were all so reserved , that I cannot undertake to say even that .
 MrLorry , look again upon the prisoner .
 Supposing him wrapped up as those two passengers were , is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them .
 No .
 You will not swear , MrLorry , that he was not one of them .
 No .
 So at least you say he may have been one of them .
 Yes .
 Except that I remember them both to have beenlike myselftimorous of highwaymen , and the prisoner has not a timorous air .
 Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity , MrLorry .
 I certainly have seen that .
 MrLorry , look once more upon the prisoner .
 Have you seen him , to your certain knowledge , before .
 I have .
 When .
 At what hour did he come on board .
 At a little after midnight .
 In the dead of the night .
 Was he the only passenger who came on board at that untimely hour .
 Never mind about ëhappening , ' MrLorry .
 He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night .
 He was .
 Were you travelling alone , MrLorry , or with any companion .
 With two companions .
 A gentleman and lady .
 They are here .
 They are here .
 Had you any conversation with the prisoner .
 The young lady , to whom all eyes had been turned before , and were now turned again , stood up where she had sat .
 Her father rose with her , and kept her hand drawn through his arm .
 Miss Manette , look upon the prisoner .
 To be confronted with such pity , and such earnest youth and beauty , was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd .
 Standing , as it were , apart with her on the edge of his grave , not all the staring curiosity that looked on , could , for the moment , nerve him to remain quite still .
 His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden .
 and his efforts to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour rushed to his heart .
 The buzz of the great flies was loud again .
 Miss Manette , have you seen the prisoner before .
 Yes , sir .
 Where .
 You are the young lady just now referred to .
 O .
 most unhappily , I am .
 Miss Manette , had you any conversation with the prisoner on that passage across the Channel .
 Yes , sir .
 Recall it .
 In the midst of a profound stillness , she faintly began : When the gentleman came on board .
 Do you mean the prisoner .
 inquired the Judge , knitting his brows .
 Yes , my Lord .
 Then say the prisoner .
 Let me interrupt you for a moment .
 Had he come on board alone .
 No .
 How many were with him .
 Two French gentlemen .
 Had they conferred together .
 They had conferred together until the last moment , when it was necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat .
 Some papers had been handed about among them , but I don't know what papers .
 Like these in shape and size .
 Now , to the prisoner's conversation , Miss Manette .
 Buzzing from the blue-flies .
 Did he say anything about America , Miss Manette .
 Be particular .
 Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed , will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators .
 Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent as she gave this evidence , and , in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down , watched its effect upon the counsel for and against .
 Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court .
 insomuch , that a great majority of the foreheads there , might have been mirrors reflecting the witness , when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington .
 Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet , or speak to his conversation with your daughter .
 Sir , I can do neither .
 Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either .
 He answered , in a low voice , There is .
 He answered , in a tone that went to every heart , A long imprisonment .
 Were you newly released on the occasion in question .
 They tell me so .
 Have you no remembrance of the occasion .
 None .
 My mind is a blank , from some timeI cannot even say what timewhen I employed myself , in my captivity , in making shoes , to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here .
 She had become familiar to me , when a gracious God restored my faculties .
 but , I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar .
 I have no remembrance of the process .
 The witness was quite sure .
 Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner .
 Not so like the witness said as that he could be mistaken .
  Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part .
 My present name , though but slightly changed from my mother's , is not , as you will remember , my own .
 I wish to tell you what that is , and why I am in England .
 said the Doctor of Beauvais .
 Stop .
 Tell me when I ask you , not now .
 If your suit should prosper , if Lucie should love you , you shall tell me on your marriage morning .
 Do you promise .
 Willingly .
 It was dark when Charles Darnay left him , and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home .
 she hurried into the room alonefor Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairsand was surprised to find his reading-chair empty .
 My father .
 she called to him .
 Father dear .
 She came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night .
 He slept heavily , and his tray of shoemaking tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual .
 Sydney had been working double tides that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in succession , making a grand clearance among MrStryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation .
 The clearance was effected at last .
 the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up .
 everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric , and fogs legal , and bring grist to the mill again .
 I am .
 DO you .
 Yes .
 And not for money .
 What do you say now .
 I don't feel disposed to say much .
 Who is she .
 Guess .
 Do I know her .
 Guess .
 And you , returned Sydney , busy concocting the punch , are such a sensitive and poetical spirit .
 You are a luckier , if you mean that .
 I don't mean that .
 I mean I am a man of moremore .
 Say gallantry , while you are about it , suggested Carton .
 Go on , said Sydney Carton .
 It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar , to be ashamed of anything , returned Sydney .
 you ought to be much obliged to me .
 Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made , and laughed .
 I never saw you do it yet , muttered Carton .
 I do it because it's politic .
 I do it on principle .
 And look at me .
 I get on .
 You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , answered Carton , with a careless air .
 I wish you would keep to that .
 As to me will you never understand that I am incorrigible .
 He asked the question with some appearance of scorn .
 You have no business to be incorrigible , was his friend's answer , delivered in no very soothing tone .
 I have no business to be , at all , that I know of , said Sydney Carton .
 Who is the lady .
 I did .
 Certainly .
 and in these chambers .
 Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
 drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend .
 Carton , still drinking the punch , rejoined , Why should I be astonished .
 You approve .
 I'll think of it , said Sydney .
 Accordingly , MrStryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens .
 that failing , to Ranelagh .
 that unaccountably failing too , it behoved him to present himself in Soho , and there declare his noble mind .
 Halloa .
 said MrStryver .
 How do you do .
 I hope you are well .
 It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place , or space .
 He was so much too big for Tellson's , that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall .
 The House itself , magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective , lowered displeased , as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat .
 Can I do anything for you , MrStryver .
 asked MrLorry , in his business character .
 Why , no , thank you .
 this is a private visit to yourself , MrLorry .
 I have come for a private word .
 Oh dear me .
 cried MrLorry , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor dubiously .
 Oh dear me , sir .
 repeated Stryver , drawing back .
 Oh dear you , sir .
 What may your meaning be , MrLorry .
 MrLorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the feather of a pen .
 Am I not prosperous .
 asked Stryver .
 And advancing .
 If you come to advancing you know , said MrLorry , delighted to be able to make another admission , nobody can doubt that .
 Then what on earth is your meaning , MrLorry .
 demanded Stryver , perceptibly crestfallen .
 Well .
 IWere you going there now .
 asked MrLorry .
 Straight .
 said Stryver , with a plump of his fist on the desk .
 Then I think I wouldn't , if I was you .
 Because , said MrLorry , I wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed .
 MrLorry glanced at the distant House , and glanced at the angry Stryver .
 Then you mean to tell me , MrLorry , said Stryver , squaring his elbows , that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool .
 Not exactly so .
 I mean to tell you , MrStryver , said MrLorry , reddening , that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips .
 and that if I knew any manwhich I hope I do notwhose taste was so coarse , and whose temper was so overbearing , that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk , not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind .
 The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put MrStryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry .
 MrLorry's veins , methodical as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn .
 That is what I mean to tell you , sir , said MrLorry .
 Pray let there be no mistake about it .
 MrStryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while , and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him the toothache .
 He broke the awkward silence by saying : 
 Do you ask me for my advice , MrStryver .
 Yes , I do .
 Very good .
 Then I give it , and you have repeated it correctly .
 And all I can say of it is , laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh , that thisha , ha .
 beats everything past , present , and to come .
 Not I .
 said Stryver , whistling .
 I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense .
 I can only find it for myself .
 I suppose sense in certain quarters .
 you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense .
 It's new to me , but you are right , I dare say .
 How long would you keep me in town .
 Oh .
 It is only a question of a few hours .
 I could go to Soho in the evening , and come to your chambers afterwards .
 The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty .
 Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow , he got it down .
 And now , said MrStryver , shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general , when it was down , my way out of this , is , to put you all in the wrong .
 It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician , in which he found great relief .
 You shall not put me in the wrong , young lady , said MrStryver .
 I'll do that for you .
 Well .
 said that good-natured emissary , after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the question .
 I have been to Soho .
 To Soho .
 repeated MrStryver , coldly .
 Oh , to be sure .
 What am I thinking of .
 And I have no doubt , said MrLorry , that I was right in the conversation we had .
 My opinion is confirmed , and I reiterate my advice .
 I assure you , returned MrStryver , in the friendliest way , that I am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on the poor father's account .
 I know this must always be a sore subject with the family .
 let us say no more about it .
 I don't understand you , said MrLorry .
 I dare say not , rejoined Stryver , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way .
 no matter , no matter .
 But it does matter , MrLorry urged .
 MrLorry was so taken aback , that he looked quite stupidly at MrStryver shouldering him towards the door , with an appearance of showering generosity , forbearance , and goodwill , on his erring head .
 Make the best of it , my dear sir , said Stryver .
 say no more about it .
 thank you again for allowing me to sound you .
 good night .
 If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette .
 He had been there often , during a whole year , and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there .
 When he cared to talk , he talked well .
 but , the cloud of caring for nothing , which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness , was very rarely pierced by the light within him .
 He was shown up-stairs , and found Lucie at her work , alone .
 She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table .
 But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places , she observed a change in it .
 I fear you are not well , MrCarton .
 No .
 But the life I lead , Miss Manette , is not conducive to health .
 What is to be expected of , or by , such profligates .
 God knows it is a shame .
 Then why not change it .
 Looking gently at him again , she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes .
 There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : 
 It is too late for that .
 I shall never be better than I am .
 I shall sink lower , and be worse .
 He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand .
 The table trembled in the silence that followed .
 She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed .
 He knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : 
 Pray forgive me , Miss Manette .
 I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you .
  We will say , to put a case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little forge .
 We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again .
 Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him .
 The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground .
 He has always kept it by him , said MrLorry , with an anxious look at his friend .
 Now , would it not be better that he should let it go .
 Still , the Doctor , with shaded forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground .
 You do not find it easy to advise me .
 said MrLorry .
 I quite understand it to be a nice question .
 And yet I think And there he shook his head , and stopped .
 He looked like his illustration , as he raised his eyes to MrLorry's face .
 There was another silence .
 You see , too , said the Doctor , tremulously , it is such an old companion .
 I would not keep it , said MrLorry , shaking his head .
 for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted .
 I would recommend him to sacrifice it .
 I only want your authority .
 I am sure it does no good .
 Come .
 Give me your authority , like a dear good man .
 For his daughter's sake , my dear Manette .
 Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him .
 In her name , then , let it be done .
 I sanction it .
 But , I would not take it away while he was present .
 Let it be removed when he is not there .
 let him miss his old companion after an absence .
 He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window , and of speaking to him when no one overheard .
 We are already friends , I hope .
 Charles Darnayas was naturalasked him , in all good-humour and good-fellowship , what he did mean .
 I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking .
 I am not at all alarmed .
 Earnestness in you , is anything but alarming to me .
 Ah .
 said Carton , with a careless wave of his hand , as if he waved that away .
 On the drunken occasion in question one of a large number , as you know , I was insufferable about liking you , and not liking you .
 I wish you would forget it .
 I forgot it long ago .
 Fashion of speech again .
 But , MrDarnay , oblivion is not so easy to me , as you represent it to be to you .
 I have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it .
 If it was a light answer , returned Darnay , I beg your forgiveness for it .
 I had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside .
 I declare to you , on the faith of a gentleman , that I have long dismissed it from my mind .
 Good Heaven , what was there to dismiss .
 Have I had nothing more important to remember , in the great service you rendered me that day .
 As to the great service , said Carton , I am bound to avow to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional claptrap , I don't know that I cared what became of you , when I rendered it .
 Mind .
 I say when I rendered it .
 I am speaking of the past .
 I prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his .
 Well .
 At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog , who has never done any good , and never will .
 I don't know that you ënever will .
 Will you try .
 That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated .
 I thank you , Darnay .
 I may use that freedom with your name .
 I think so , Carton , by this time .
 They shook hands upon it , and Sydney turned away .
 Within a minute afterwards , he was , to all outward appearance , as unsubstantial as ever .
 He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife .
 but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked .
 We are thoughtful to-night .
 said Darnay , drawing his arm about her .
 Yes , dearest Charles , with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him .
 we are rather thoughtful to-night , for we have something on our mind to-night .
 What is it , my Lucie .
 Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it .
 Will I promise .
 What will I not promise to my Love .
 What , indeed , with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him .
 I think , Charles , poor MrCarton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night .
 Indeed , my own .
 Why so .
 That is what you are not to ask me .
 But I thinkI knowhe does .
 If you know it , it is enough .
 What would you have me do , my Life .
 It is a painful reflection to me , said Charles Darnay , quite astounded , that I should have done him any wrong .
 I never thought this of him .
 She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man , that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours .
 The supplication touched him home .
 I will always remember it , dear Heart .
 I will remember it as long as I live .
 At first , there were times , though she was a perfectly happy young wife , when her work would slowly fall from her hands , and her eyes would be dimmed .
 For , there was something coming in the echoes , something light , afar off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much .
 Fluttering hopes and doubtshopes , of a love as yet unknown to her : doubts , of her remaining upon earth , to enjoy that new delightdivided her breast .
 Among the echoes then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave .
 and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would mourn for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like waves .
 Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together , weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives , and making it predominate nowhere , Lucie heard in the echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds .
 Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them .
 her father's firm and equal .
 Lo , Miss Pross , in harness of string , awakening the echoes , as an unruly charger , whip-corrected , snorting and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden .
 MrStryver shouldered his way through the law , like some great engine forcing itself through turbid water , and dragged his useful friend in his wake , like a boat towed astern .
 As the boat so favoured is usually in a rough plight , and mostly under water , so , Sydney had a swamped life of it .
 But , easy and strong custom , unhappily so much easier and stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace , made it the life he was to lead .
 and he no more thought of emerging from his state of lion's jackal , than any real jackal may be supposed to think of rising to be a lion .
 Stryver was rich .
 had married a florid widow with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads .
 But , there were other echoes , from a distance , that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time .
 And it was now , about little Lucie's sixth birthday , that they began to have an awful sound , as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising .
 On a night in mid-July , one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine , MrLorry came in late , from Tellson's , and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window .
 It was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place .
 I began to think , said MrLorry , pushing his brown wig back , that I should have to pass the night at Tellson's .
 We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn .
 There is such an uneasiness in Paris , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us .
 Our customers over there , seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough .
 There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England .
 A bad look , you say , my dear Darnay .
 Yes , but we don't know what reason there is in it .
 People are so unreasonable .
 Some of us at Tellson's are getting old , and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion .
 Still , said Darnay , you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is .
 Here he is , said the Doctor , entering the dark room at the moment .
 I am quite glad you are at home .
 for these hurries and forebodings by which I have been surrounded all day long , have made me nervous without reason .
 You are not going out , I hope .
 No .
 I am going to play backgammon with you , if you like , said the Doctor .
 I don't think I do like , if I may speak my mind .
 I am not fit to be pitted against you to-night .
 Is the teaboard still there , Lucie .
 I can't see .
 Thank ye , my dear .
 The precious child is safe in bed .
 And sleeping soundly .
 Not a theory .
 it was a fancy .
 A fancy , then , my wise pet , said MrLorry , patting her hand .
 They are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not .
 Only hear them .
 Keep near to me , Jacques Three , cried Defarge .
 and do you , Jacques One and Two , separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can .
 Where is my wife .
 Eh , well .
 Here you see me .
 said madame , composed as ever , but not knitting to-day .
 Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe , in place of the usual softer implements , and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife .
 Where do you go , my wife .
 I go , said madame , with you at present .
 You shall see me at the head of women , by-and-bye .
 Come , then .
 cried Defarge , in a resounding voice .
 Patriots and friends , we are ready .
 The Bastille .
 With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word , the living sea rose , wave on wave , depth on depth , and overflowed the city to that point .
 Alarm-bells ringing , drums beating , the sea raging and thundering on its new beach , the attack began .
 Deep ditch , single drawbridge , massive stone walls , eight great towers , cannon , muskets , fire and smoke .
 One drawbridge down .
 Work , comrades all , work .
 Work , Jacques One , Jacques Two , Jacques One Thousand , Jacques Two Thousand , Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand .
 in the name of all the Angels or the Devilswhich you preferwork .
 Thus Defarge of the wine-shop , still at his gun , which had long grown hot .
 So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on , that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea , until he was landed in the outer courtyard of the Bastille .
 There , against an angle of a wall , he made a struggle to look about him .
 Jacques Three was nearly at his side .
 Madame Defarge , still heading some of her women , was visible in the inner distance , and her knife was in her hand .
 Everywhere was tumult , exultation , deafening and maniacal bewilderment , astounding noise , yet furious dumb-show .
 The Prisoners .
 The Records .
 The secret cells .
 The instruments of torture .
 The Prisoners .
 Show me the North Tower .
 said Defarge .
 Quick .
 I will faithfully , replied the man , if you will come with me .
 But there is no one there .
 What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five , North Tower .
 asked Defarge .
 Quick .
  He is accused by Saint Antoine .
 One word , the Doctor entreated .
 Will you tell me who denounced him .
 It is against rule , answered the first .
 but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here .
 What other .
 Do YOU ask , Citizen Doctor .
 Then , said he of Saint Antoine , with a strange look , you will be answered tomorrow .
 Now , I am dumb .
 As their wine was measuring out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart .
 In going , he had to face Miss Pross .
 No sooner did he face her , than Miss Pross uttered a scream , and clapped her hands .
 What is the matter .
 said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream .
 speaking in a vexed , abrupt voice though in a low tone , and in English .
 Don't call me Solomon .
 Do you want to be the death of me .
 asked the man , in a furtive , frightened way .
 Brother , brother .
 cried Miss Pross , bursting into tears .
 Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question .
 Then hold your meddlesome tongue , said Solomon , and come out , if you want to speak to me .
 Pay for your wine , and come out .
 Who's this man .
 Let him come out too , said Solomon .
 Does he think me a ghost .
 How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from .
 cried Miss Pross , to give me such a greeting , and show me no affection .
 Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence .
 If you expect me to be surprised , said her brother Solomon , I am not surprised .
 I knew you were here .
 I know of most people who are here .
 If you really don't want to endanger my existencewhich I half believe you dogo your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine .
 I am busy .
 I am an official .
 I said so .
 cried her brother , interrupting .
 I knew it .
 You want to be the death of me .
 I shall be rendered Suspected , by my own sister .
 Just as I am getting on .
 The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid .
 cried Miss Pross .
 Far rather would I never see you again , dear Solomon , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall .
 Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us , and I will detain you no longer .
 Good Miss Pross .
 As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers .
 As if MrLorry had not known it for a fact , years ago , in the quiet corner in Soho , that this precious brother had spent her money and left her .
 I say .
 Might I ask the favour .
 As to whether your name is John Solomon , or Solomon John .
 The official turned towards him with sudden distrust .
 He had not previously uttered a word .
 What do you mean .
 Well , I don't know all I mean , for I can't call to mind what your name was , over the water .
 But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables .
 T'other one's was one syllable .
 I know you .
 You was a spywitness at the Bailey .
 What , in the name of the Father of Lies , own father to yourself , was you called at that time .
 Barsad , said another voice , striking in .
 The speaker who struck in , was Sydney Carton .
 He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat , and he stood at MrCruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself .
 Don't be alarmed , my dear Miss Pross .
 I arrived at MrLorry's , to his surprise , yesterday evening .
 we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful .
 I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother .
 I wish you had a better employed brother than MrBarsad .
 I wish for your sake MrBarsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons .
 Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy , under the gaolers .
 The spy , who was pale , turned paler , and asked him how he dared .
 What purpose .
 the spy asked .
 It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street .
 Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your companyat the office of Tellson's Bank , for instance .
 Under a threat .
 Did I say that .
 Then , why should I go there .
 Do you mean that you won't say , sir .
 the spy irresolutely asked .
 You apprehend me very clearly , MrBarsad .
 I won't .
 Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill , in such a business as he had in his secret mind , and with such a man as he had to do with .
 His practised eye saw it , and made the most of it .
 Come , come , MrBarsad .
 exclaimed Sydney .
 Don't be ungrateful .
 But for my great respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction .
 Do you go with me to the Bank .
 I'll hear what you have got to say .
 Yes , I'll go with you .
 I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street .
 Let me take your arm , Miss Pross .
 This is not a good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected .
 and as your escort knows MrBarsad , I will invite him to MrLorry's with us .
 Are we ready .
 Come then .
 Miss Pross's brother , sir , said Sydney .
 I told you you had a remarkable face , MrBarsad , observed Carton , coolly .
 Pray sit down .
 As he took a chair himself , he supplied the link that MrLorry wanted , by saying to him with a frown , Witness at that trial .
 MrLorry immediately remembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence .
 Arrested for all that .
 When was it done , MrBarsad .
 Just now , if at all .
 He may not have known of it beforehand , said MrLorry .
 But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law .
 You need have good cards , sir , said the spy .
 I'll run them over .
 I'll see what I hold , MrLorry , you know what a brute I am .
 I wish you'd give me a little brandy .
 Not to understand your play , returned the spy , somewhat uneasily .
 I play my Ace , Denunciation of MrBarsad to the nearest Section Committee .
 Look over your hand , MrBarsad , and see what you have .
 Don't hurry .
 He drew the bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank it off .
 He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him .
 Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful .
 Look over your hand carefully , MrBarsad .
 Take time .
 You scarcely seem to like your hand , said Sydney , with the greatest composure .
 Do you play .
 I play my Ace , MrBarsad , said Carton , taking the answer on himself , and looking at his watch , without any scruple , in a very few minutes .
 I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , said Sydney Carton .
 I have thoroughly made up my mind about it .
 And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet enumerated .
 That friend and fellow-Sheep , who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons .
 You don't know him , said the spy , quickly .
 French , eh .
 repeated Carton , musing .
 Not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word .
 Well , he may be .
 Is , I assure you , said the spy .
 though it's not important .
 I think not .
 I am sure not .
 It can't be , said the spy .
 Provincial , said the spy .
 cried Carton , striking his open hand on the table , as a light broke clearly on his mind .
 Cly .
 Disguised , but the same man .
 We had that man before us at the Old Bailey .
 Here , MrLorry became aware , from where he sat , of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall .
 Tracing it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on MrCruncher's head .
 Here , MrLorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate , and MrCruncher rose and stepped forward .
 His hair could not have been more violently on end , if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built .
 Unseen by the spy , MrCruncher stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff .
 That there Roger Cly , master , said MrCruncher , with a taciturn and iron-bound visage .
 So YOU put him in his coffin .
 I did .
 Who took him out of it .
 I mean , said MrCruncher , that he warn't never in it .
 No .
 Not he .
 I'll have my head took off , if he was ever in it .
 The spy looked round at the two gentlemen .
 they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry .
 I tell you , said Jerry , that you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin .
 Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly .
 It was a take in .
 Me and two more knows it .
 How do you know it .
 No .
 returned the spy .
 I throw up .
 I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death , and that Cly was so ferreted up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham .
 Though how this man knows it was a sham , is a wonder of wonders to me .
 Not very much .
 You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie .
 I tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , said the spy , firmly .
 Why need you tell me what I have not asked .
 You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie .
 I am sometimes .
  Clearly plots , said Jacques Three .
 Transparently .
 Rely upon the patriotic Jury , dear citizeness .
 I answer for my fellow-Jurymen .
 Now , let me see , said Madame Defarge , pondering again .
 Yet once more .
 Can I spare this Doctor to my husband .
 I have no feeling either way .
 Can I spare him .
 He would count as one head , observed Jacques Three , in a low voice .
 We really have not heads enough .
 it would be a pity , I think .
 The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses .
 The little citizen , not to be outdone , declared her to be a celestial witness .
 He must take his chance , said Madame Defarge .
 No , I cannot spare him .
 You are engaged at three o'clock .
 you are going to see the batch of to-day executed .
 You .
 I , said madame , am equally engaged at the same place .
 After it is oversay at eight to-nightcome you to me , in Saint Antoine , and we will give information against these people at my Section .
 Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door , and there expounded her further views to them thus : 
 I shall be there before the commencement .
 It was nothing to her , that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers .
 she saw , not him , but them .
 It was nothing to her , that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan .
 that was insufficient punishment , because they were her natural enemies and her prey , and as such had no right to live .
 To appeal to her , was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity , even for herself .
 If she had been laid low in the streets , in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged , she would not have pitied herself .
 nor , if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow , would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent here there .
 My opinion , miss , returned MrCruncher , is as you're right .
 Likewise wot I'll stand by you , right or wrong .
 I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures , said Miss Pross , wildly crying , that I am incapable of forming any plan .
 Are YOU capable of forming any plan , my dear good MrCruncher .
 Respectin' a future spear o' life , miss , returned MrCruncher , I hope so .
 Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine , I think not .
 Would you do me the favour , miss , to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis .
 Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be , said Miss Pross , striving to dry her eyes and compose herself , I have no doubt it is best that MrsCruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence .
 O my poor darlings .
 And still Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
 If we ever get back to our native land , said Miss Pross , you may rely upon my telling MrsCruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said .
 and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time .
 Now , pray let us think .
 My esteemed MrCruncher , let us think .
 Still , Madame Defarge , pursuing her way along the streets , came nearer and nearer .
 If you were to go before , said Miss Pross , and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here , and were to wait somewhere for me .
 wouldn't that be best .
 MrCruncher thought it might be best .
 Where could you wait for me .
 asked Miss Pross .
 By the cathedral door , said Miss Pross .
 Would it be much out of the way , to take me in , near the great cathedral door between the two towers .
 No , miss , answered MrCruncher .
 Then , like the best of men , said Miss Pross , go to the posting-house straight , and make that change .
 I am doubtful , said MrCruncher , hesitating and shaking his head , about leaving of you , you see .
 We don't know what may happen .
 The basin fell to the ground broken , and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge .
 By strange stern ways , and through much staining blood , those feet had come to meet that water .
 You might , from your appearance , be the wife of Lucifer , said Miss Pross , in her breathing .
 Nevertheless , you shall not get the better of me .
 I am an English woman .
 Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully , but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay .
 She saw a tight , hard , wiry woman before her , as MrLorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand , in the years gone by .
 She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend .
 Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy .
 It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment , said Madame Defarge .
 Good patriots will know what that means .
 Let me see her .
 Go tell her that I wish to see her .
 Do you hear .
 If those eyes of yours were bed-winches , returned Miss Pross , and I was an English four-poster , they shouldn't loose a splinter of me .
 No , you wicked foreign woman .
 I am your match .
 Woman imbecile and pig-like .
 said Madame Defarge , frowning .
 I take no answer from you .
 I demand to see her .
 Either tell her that I demand to see her , or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her .
 This , with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm .
 I am a Briton , said Miss Pross , I am desperate .
 I don't care an English Twopence for myself .
 I know that the longer I keep you here , the greater hope there is for my Ladybird .
 I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head , if you lay a finger on me .
 Thus Miss Pross , with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence , and every rapid sentence a whole breath .
 Thus Miss Pross , who had never struck a blow in her life .
 Perhaps the following silence , perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face , perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion , whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone .
 Three of the doors she opened swiftly , and looked in .
 Never .
 said Miss Pross , who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer .
 As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not , you are uncertain what to do , said Miss Pross to herself .
 and you shall not know that , if I can prevent your knowing it .
 and know that , or not know that , you shall not leave here while I can hold you .
 Madame Defarge made at the door .
 Miss Pross , on the instinct of the moment , seized her round the waist in both her arms , and held her tight .
 It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike .
 Miss Pross , with the vigorous tenacity of love , always so much stronger than hate , clasped her tight , and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had .
 The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face .
 but , Miss Pross , with her head down , held her round the waist , and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman .
 All this was in a second .
 As the smoke cleared , leaving an awful stillness , it passed out on the air , like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground .
 Is there any noise in the streets .
 she asked him .
 The usual noises , MrCruncher replied .
 and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect .
 I don't hear you , said Miss Pross .
 What do you say .
 Is there any noise in the streets now .
 asked Miss Pross again , presently .
 Again MrCruncher nodded his head .
 I don't hear it .
 Gone deaf in an hour .
 said MrCruncher , ruminating , with his mind much disturbed .
 wot's come to her .
 I feel , said Miss Pross , as if there had been a flash and a crash , and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life .
 If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts , now very nigh their journey's end , said MrCruncher , glancing over his shoulder , it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world .
 And indeed she never did .
 Along the Paris streets , the death-carts rumble , hollow and harsh .
 Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine .
 All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself , are fused in the one realisation , Guillotine .
 And yet there is not in France , with its rich variety of soil and climate , a blade , a leaf , a root , a sprig , a peppercorn , which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror .
 Crush humanity out of shape once more , under similar hammers , and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms .
 Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again , and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind .
 On the steps of a church , awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils , stands the Spy and prison-sheep .
 He looks into the first of them : not there .
 He looks into the second : not there .
 He already asks himself , Has he sacrificed me .
 when his face clears , as he looks into the third .
 Which is Evremonde .
 says a man behind him .
 That .
 At the back there .
 With his hand in the girl's .
 Yes .
 The man cries , Down , Evremonde .
 To the Guillotine all aristocrats .
 Down , Evremonde .
 Hush , hush .
 the Spy entreats him , timidly .
 And why not , citizen .
 Therese .
 she cries , in her shrill tones .
 Who has seen her .
 Therese Defarge .
 She never missed before , says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood .
 Louder , the woman recommends .
 The second tumbril empties and moves on .
 the third comes up .
 Crash .
 And the knitting-women , never faltering or pausing in their Work , count Two .
 Or you to me , says Sydney Carton .
 Keep your eyes upon me , dear child , and mind no other object .
 I mind nothing while I hold your hand .
 I shall mind nothing when I let it go , if they are rapid .
 They will be rapid .
 Fear not .
 Tell me what it is .
 What then , my gentle sister .
 It cannot be , my child .
 there is no Time there , and no trouble there .
 You comfort me so much .
 I am so ignorant .
 Am I to kiss you now .
 Is the moment come .
 Yes .
 They said of him , about the city that night , that it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there .
 Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic .
 One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axea womanhad asked at the foot of the same scaffold , not long before , to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her .
 If he had given any utterance to his , and they were prophetic , they would have been these : 
 I see Barsad , and Cly , Defarge , The Vengeance , the Juryman , the Judge , long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old , perishing by this retributive instrument , before it shall cease out of its present use .
 I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss , and , in their struggles to be truly free , in their triumphs and defeats , through long years to come , I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth , gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out .
 It is a far , far better thing that I do , than I have ever done .
 it is a far , far better rest that I go to than I have ever known .
